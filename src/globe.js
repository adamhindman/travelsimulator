          'The first cable was laid across the Atlantic in 1858. It only lasted a couple of weeks before breaking down, but that was enough to plant the idea of instantaneous global communication. Today, there are about a dozen transatlantic cables, relaying hundreds of terabits of information every second.</p><p>Whereas the first telegraph cable carried only a stilted, formal exchange between Queen Victoria of England, and President James Buchanan of the United States, modern cables carry everything from pornography, to unboxing videos, to vape trick videos, and even NFTs. Every piece of DLC downloaded in Fortnite, every unwanted piece of email spam, every ill-informed tirade on Twitter: those ideas all started right here, with this cable.</p><p>Well, strictly speaking, there is no cable here anymore. The original cable was removed after it broke in the 1850s.</p><p>But, the route remains, and it is as important to the history of our noble species as the ancient migration out of Africa, or the path Apollo 11 took from the Earth to the moon.<p>That is why you are in a rowboat, about 1500 kilometers east of Heart\'s Content, Newfoundland, and about the same distance from Valentia Island, in Ireland. These are the terminal points for the original transatlantic telegraph. You have decided it would be fun and meaningful to re-enact the journey a bit of information would have taken, but in an open-topped row boat.</p><p>A storm on the second day overturned the boat, and you lost most of your supplies, but were able to right the ship and even retrieve one of the oars. By paddling for a few minutes on one side of the boat, then swapping the oar to the other side and paddling the same number of strokes, you manage to maintain a relatively straight line, on a compass bearing which puts you about two miles above the seafloor where the cable used to be, over 170 years ago.</p><p>It\'s hard work, rowing this boat. Fortunately, there is plenty of salty water, fish, and seaweed to prepare, and the sharks mostly leave you alone. As you row, you think about all the data that would be zipping around right underneath you, if the transatlantic telegraph cable was still operational. What telegraph would you send right now, if you could? Maybe "Help", or even just "SOS".</p><p>What an amazing voyage, and it\'s only halfway done!</p>',

Originally built in the 16th century, it was destroyed in the war of the 1990s, then reconstructed, brick by brick. The new bridge has lost none of the charm of the original, nor the striking profile of its steep rainbow arch.</p><p>Today, it is a place where young daredevils dive 80 feet into the cold, deep water of the Neretva, to the delighted applause of the tourists seated at nearby cafes.</p><p>Standing at the apex of the bridge, you stare down past your toes, into the green-black river swiftly flowing beneath you. You feel an impulse of nervousness, and if you didn't have an audience, you wonder whether you'd go through with this crazy stunt.</p><p>\"Reverse 4½ somersault, pike position\" you call out. This dive would earn you a medal at the Olympics if you pulled it off there, but right now you'd be satisfied with just not embarassing yourself in front of the locals.</p><p>You turn around, get into position, and take a blind leap backward off the bridge, pulling your legs in and turning through the air. You see the quaint skyline of Mostar whirling in your field of view, and glimpse the cafe crowd watching you you in rapt attention.</p><p>You straighten out before hitting the water, and break the surface with only the slightest ripple. The water is cold, and murky, and you extend an arm expecting to touch the bottom, but never do.</p><p>When you emerge downstream, people are still on their feet, cheering and calling out your name.</p><p>The mayor shows up to help haul you out of the water. He is wearing a suit, and even has a sash that says 'mayor' in Serbian. He invites you to tour the city, and you shake a lot of hands. The people who saw your dive praise you, and the people who weren't there express the deepest regret that they missed it.</p><p>The mayor offers to build a statue in your honor, but you decline. \"It was just a dive,\" you say modestly, \"gravity did all the work.\"</p>Instead, they give you a plaque.</p>",

          'While strolling in the high street one day, you pass a book shop window, and notice the new Inspector Piggsbed mystery novel has been released. You\'ve read all the cozy mysteries in this great series already, and are delighted to find a new one is available. Without a moment\'s hesitation, you buy a copy and sit down on the curb to read it:</p><p><blockquote><h4>The Case of the Falling Body</h4><p><cite>By R. W. Trounce</cite></p>Inspector Piggsbed was called to the scene of the accident. Or, shall we say, the scene of the crime, for he would not have been called to a field in Dumpleshire at 6 o\'clock in the morning — before he\'d even had his tea — if somebody had not suspected foul play.</p><p>The field was empty, save for a few distant, indolent cows, watching the busy police disrupt the quietude of their bucolic home.</p><p>The deceased (male, mid-twenties) was dressed in a khaki colored jumpsuit, now muddy from the wet ground upon which he lay. He had an empty backpack strapped to his torso, its single compartment opened at the top. He also wore a helmet, which was cracked and splintered, as was the head it contained.</p><p>"Looks like he died on impact, Inspector. Impact from a great height..." the medical examiner made a sound that started quietly, and rose steadily in volume, as he mimicked someone falling from the sky. "shooooOOOOOOOOO.... SPLAT! Ha ha!"</p><p>"I\'ll thank you to show some decorum, officer. This is no laughing matter, a man has died."</p><p>The ME lowered his head, chastened, and waited for the inspector to continue.</p><p>"It appears this unfortunate man died after jumping out of an airplane. Or being pushed. At any rate, the parachute he dependent upon to slow his descent failed to do so. I believe I know how it happened, and who the murderer is."</p><p>The other officers were astonished at this, though their long history of working with the famous Inspector Piggsbed should have taught them that swift and seemingly incredible deductions of this kind were altogether commonplace whenever that brilliant detective was in play.</p><p>"But how could you know?" said a fat Sergeant, his mouth agape.</p><p>"Quite simple really. All the clues are here, before you. Nothing is hidden from view."</p><p>He turned to the cheeky Medical Examiner and said, with an almost undetectable trace of smugness in his voice: "Can you solve this riddle?"</p></blockquote><p>"No!" you say out loud. "You don\'t have Inspector Piggsbed\'s brilliant intellect, or his nose for justice!"</p><p>You continue on to the solution, eager to learn how it played out:</p><p><blockquote>The inspector noticed that no parachute was visible. He thus concluded that the man\'s normal parachute had been replaced by an ice parachute (that is, a parachute made out of ice instead of nylon). Instead of slowing his fall, the brittle ice parachute shattered shortly after being deployed, and the man fell to the ground, dead. The ice fell too, and then melted, explaining the muddy ground beneath the victim\'s body.</p><p>This left only one question: who was the murderer? Who packed the fatal parachute?</p><p>"Quite simple," said Piggsbed, secretly enjoying having a rapt audience hanging on his every word.</p><p>"It is a principle of criminal psychology that the murderer is always drawn to return to the scene of the crime. Officer, I think we should interrogate those cows watching us right now..."</p><p>At that, one of the cows (a spotted one) began running awkwardly toward a nearby copse of trees by the motorway. As it ran, only its front legs seemed to move, and eventually it stumbled and fell to the ground in a tangled mass.</p><p>When the police caught up to it, it turned out the "cow" was really a man wearing a cow suit in order to blend in to the scenery and avoid suspicion. Upon questioning, he turned out to be the victim\'s mortal enemy, and quickly confessed to his heinous crime.</p><p>He was convicted, and sentenced to the stiffest possible penalty under Her Majesty\'s law: four months in prison, and a written apology to the farmer who owned the field.</p></blockquote><p></p>You close the book, and sigh with pleasure:  Piggsbed always gets his man!</p>',

They all agree that it\'s at least a little unusual to see a 3 kilogram frog leading a tourist with such confidence and sense of purpose.</p><p>Twenty minutes or so later, you arrive at a nice, but ordinary looking house near the harbor. Frederick, which you take for granted is the frog\'s given name, hops into the house through the open door. Hesitating only a moment, you follow it inside.</p><p>A man is waiting for you in the living room, sitting in an armchair, with the frog in his lap. He is middle-aged, with close-cropped, curly hair. He is wearing glasses, and a tan linen shirt and blue jacket, and gives off the air of a teacher, or professor, or a scholar.</p><p>He smiles at you. "Thank you for humoring me, I understand my invitation was a little unorthodox. I asked Frederick to bring you here because I need your help."</p><p>The man, whose name turns out to be Francisco, explains that he has been training Goliath frogs to act as companion animals for the elderly and disabled. But, a shadowy criminal organization got word of his research, and kidnapped most of his, as he calls them, \'students\'. Only Frederick, who was out of the house on an errand at the time, was spared.</p><p>"They will use them as thieves, spies, even assassins. I cannot allow my work to be used for evil. I have heard you are an adventurer, and so I beg you to bring them back, and put a stop to these men once and for all."</p><p>His honest eyes are pleading.</p><p>"I\'ll do it," you say.</p><p>48 hours later, you have wrapped up the case. You managed to track down the criminal organization, which it turned out was tied to all the recent jewel thefts in Equatorial Guinea. They were holding the trained Goliath frogs in a swamp in the Sanaga basin.</p><p>You sadly inform Francisco that his star pupil, Frederick the frog, had been working with the thieves all along, including in the plot to kidnap the other frogs. You and Frederick had had a showdown in a helicopter hangar, and only one of you had walked (not hopped) away.</p><p>Francisco is quiet, but nods his head.</p><p>"I understand," he says.

Looking down into the enclosure, you can see the ancient sword, plunged to the hilt into some dirt, and surrounded by some decorative gravel.</p><p>You'd think that the chosen one, chosen by destiny to lift the sword, would not be stopped by a low concrete wall.

Even if the front gate were left open, an attacker marching up the road would be killed a dozen times by arrows, guns, or even rocks thrown from the high walls. Sure enough, the citadel has never been breached.</p><p>Sounds like a challenge!</p><p>The rampart at the rear of the complex is tall, round, and perched at the edge of a cliff. This makes it not only nearly impossible to climb, but extremely dangerous to even attempt. The Haitian defenders knew there's no way an invading army could get a commando unit inside the citadel that way, and that makes it the perfect way to get inside.</p><p>That's why, on a moonless night, dressed in black, you find yourself picking your way up the outside of the cylindrical tower. Your progress is achingly slow, because the slightest mistake would result in you falling to your certain death. Your broken body would be swallowed by the mountain's thorny undergrowth, never to be found.</p><p>Halfway up the rampart, the muscles in your hands feel like they're on fire with the effort, and you start to feel like giving up. \"Why am I even doing this?\" you ask yourself.</p><p>You have no answer.</p><p>In fact, you feel like calling it quits, and coming back during the day, when the citadel is open to the public. Rather than taking an incredible risk with dubious rewards, you could be back in your hotel in an hour, having a good night's rest, then a nice breakfast in the morning. You'd come back in the afternoon, walk around at a leisurely pace. You'd see everything, talk to some people, even buy a souvenir. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p><p>Just then, you realize you've reached the top. You pull yourself over the lip of the rampart, and collapse with exhaustion. You were so scared on the way up that you almost cry with relief to be on flat ground again, not digging your fingernails into mortar while hanging over an abyss.</p><p>When you catch your breath, you stagger weakly to your feet and look around.</p><p>You can't see much due to the lack of light. There are some cannonballs across the courtyard, but it's too dark to make out much detail. Not that it would matter: if you've seen one cannonball — which you already have — you've pretty much seen them all.</p><p>You find that the doors to the interior of the citadel are locked, and you can't see through the windows, because it's as dark inside as out. Too bad, you think, there's probably some neat historical artifacts in there.</p><p>You snap a few pictures, but they're blurry and indistinct, even with the flash on.</p><p>You shuffle into your hotel room just before dawn, shaking, covered with dirt and blood, and fall into a dead sleep with your clothes still on. Later, you are arrested for trespassing.</p><p>But: Mission accomplished! After 200 years, La Citadelle Laferrière has been infiltrated at last.</p>",

His face has exaggerated features: a long nose, eyes just a little larger than they should be. His eyes change color every time you look at them, from icey blue, to green, to gray, to black. Surely this must be one of the hidden folk.</p><p>When you release him, the elf does not try to run away. He stands there tapping his foot impatiently.</p><p>"So you\'ll really grant my wish? And you won\'t try to twist it around so that it becomes a curse?"</p><p>He makes a show of looking offended. "Now, why would I do something like that? We made a bargain, you held up your side, now give me a chance to prove I\'m as good as my word."</p>"In that case, I wish for a billion dollars," you say.</p><p>He claps his hands and smiles.</p><p>"Marvelous! I shall grant your wish. May you spend it wisely!"</p><p>The elf disappears in a puff of sparkles, cackling with delight.</p><p>What a day, you think. You never know what will happen.</p><p>You sit down to eat your hotdog, and, opening the bottle of mustard, spill it all over your shirt, your pants, and even your shoes. From somewhere, the laughter of an invisible voice fills the air.</p><p>After cleaning up, and finishing your hotdog, you check your bank account: it reads $1,000,000,183.44.</p>"Waiter," you say with a smile, "I think I\'ll have another hotdog."',

There is little else to do.</p><p>On your last night here, you pen the following entry in your journal:</p><p>\"Am satisfied that life on Westfjords is possible, though not recommended.\"</p><p>The next morning, against a driving wind that blows the icy rain against your face, you pack up your remaining gull jerky and make your way across the mountains, back toward Reykhólar.</p>",

          '"Welcome to Komodo Island!" says your host, as you step off the boat. You\'ve just enjoyed a 25-mile journey from Labuan Bajo, the closest town on the mainland.</p><p>You have come to Komodo Island to see the world\'s largest reptile, the Komodo Dragon, in its natural habitat. These beautiful, emerald-colored islands are their home, and the only place in the world where a significant population of the nearly-extinct creatures survives. Whereas in former times, the Komodo Dragon was considered a monster to be avoided and hunted, now the entire island dedicated to preserving these fiersome creatures, and the money they attract.</p><p>The host says: "We make sure to feed them every morning, to keep them happy."</p><p>"And to make sure they aren\'t hungry enough to start eating tourists," you say. </p><p>The host chuckles reassuringly, and shakes his head.</p><p>"I promise you, it\'s quite safe here. We\'ve never had any problems."</p><p>You schedule a personal tour for the following day, one that will bring you in close contact with the Dragons. After strolling around the facilities for a while, you return to the rented boat you arrived in, and talk to the other guests about all the fun you\'ll have the following day. The skies have begun to darken, and it looks like a storm is approaching.</p><p>In your bunk that night, you experience the sudden, violent tropical weather this part of the world is known for. You hardly sleep at all, with the waves churning, and the rain drumming against the hull. When lightning illuminates the darkened sleeping cabin, you can see that none of the other guests are getting much sleep, either.</p><p>"Was that a scream?" one of them asks.</p><p>"It sounds like it came from the island."</p><p>In the morning, you take a Zodiac to the park, and step ashore for the second time. You are carrying your backpack, with plenty of water, sunscreen, cinnamon gum, and a couple of energy bars.</p><p>You find the visitor\'s center deserted, its front door swinging open. You call out, but there is no response. Everything is ominously silent.</p><p>"The power is out," says one of the other guests.</p><p>"Must have been the storm" you reply.</p><p>Just then, you see a flicker of movement. Something just skittered behind the building. Something long, and low to the ground. A moment later, it is followed by a rushing sound coming from the forest, like dozens of little legs crashing toward you.</p><p>"Run!" you scream, "Get back to the boat!"</p><p>You lead the confused and frightened tourists back to the Zodiac. Along the way, you encounter the host you spoke with yesterday. He looks haggard, and his clothes are ripped, covered in mud.</p><p>He says: "The storm knocked out the power supply, and we couldn\'t feed the Komodo Dragons. They got hungry, and came looking for food..."</p><p>"Is everyone safe?"</p><p>He nods. "I think so. They\'ve locked themselves inside a supply building. It\'s surrounded by Dragons, but so far the walls are holding. For how long, I don\'t know. I stayed behind to warn you not to land on the island, but it looks like I was too late."</p><p>"Let\'s hope not," you say, staring grimly into the middle distance.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, you are standing in the back of a speeding pickup truck, tossing chunks of goat meat into the mouths of a hoard of ravenous Komodo Dragons as they chase the vehicle away from the supply warehouse.</p><p>The truck bounces over the rutted, muddy roads on the island, and you are almost thrown from the vehicle more than once. You shudder to think of what would happen if you lost your footing and fell into that feeding frenzy.</p><p>In the distance, you see the door of the warehouse open. People begin tentatively poking their heads out, checking to see that all the Komodo Dragons have left.</p><p>Satisfied that they\'re out of danger for the moment, they run to the docks, and on to the waiting Coast Guard vessels. Soldiers standing behind mounted machine guns sweep the area, wary of any Komodo Dragons that didn\'t take the bait. Once everyone is on board, they gun the engines and point the ships out to the safety of deep water.</p><p>"Looks like your diversion worked," says your host, later.</p><p>The two of you are sitting on the veranda of the visitor\'s center, looking out over the jungle. You can see a couple of Komodo Dragons: lazy, fat, basking in the evening sun, looking almost gentle now that they\'re well fed.</p><p>You nod. "There\'s just one thing I don\'t understand. You said you couldn\'t feed the dragons because the power went out. What stopped you?"</p><p>He looks a little bit embarrassed. After a minute, he shrugs his shoulders and admits:</p><p>"My alarm didn\'t go off!"</p><p>You look at him angrily, then, after a beat, you both start to laugh uncontrollably.</p>',

Some say it occurred later, with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 CE. Many say there was no single date on which a person could have said "yesterday, I was a Roman, and today there are no Romans at all", but rather that this change, if it happened at all, was slow and incremental. Another group believes that the Roman empire lives on today, having evolved into the Roman Catholic church.</p><p>Still others believe, controversially, that we are all still living in Rome, and that modern inventions like (for example) "cars" are merely chariots pulled by invisible horses, conjured by Celtic druids.

It has classical proportions and decorations, with six symmetrical columns flanking a single massive, doorless portal.  </p><p>The professor nods.</p><p>"They traded with the Romans, that\'s where they picked up the Hellenistic influences.

A shudder passes through your body, as the mighty engines awaken and the grassy steppe for miles around the launchpad hums with its power. Then, with a cloud of smoke and a prolonged, ear-cracking roar, the rocket lifts off, on top of a column of fire so large and bright you can see its after-image when you close your eyes. It climbs into the sky, leaving behind a winding ribbon of smoke, and soon is out of sight.</p><p>"That was amazing!" you say, patting Erzhan on the back. "I\'ve never felt anything like that before.

Rugged limestone walls rise 300 meters on each side, blocking your escape, while providing a perfect field of fire for the anonymous marksman.</p><p>As bullets ping off the rocks next to your head, you run in a serpentine pattern, zig-zagging down the trail.

You feel the impact of the bullet, followed instantaneously by the report, and its echo off the hard canyon walls.</p><p>Warm liquid runs down your back: is it blood? As the hunter reloads, you pick yourself up and surge through the dark entrance to the cave.</p><p>Gryka e Madhe is a large cave system in Rugova, with many kilometers of unexplored tunnels, on at least five separate levels.

Even if you survive this encounter, you've still got to hike out of the canyon without any water. That would be a nice problem to have, you decide.</p><p>After an hour, you hear the crunch of gravel under boots. Only one set of them. Someone has followed you into the cave, and you have to assume it's the same person who attacked you. Their flashlight beam grows larger as they approach, illuminating your small chamber, which suddenly doesn't seem like such a great hiding spot after all.</p><p>You are holding a rock the size of a softball in your hands.</p><p>When the hunter gets close enough, you leap out and smash them with the rock.

You took the precaution of not eating for the last four days, and you\'ve worked up a serious appetite.</p><p>You take an early lead, slurping down three entire bowls in under a minute. You can really taste the lemongrass and citronella, and even though you\'re eating for speed and quantity, you take a moment to appreciate the velvety mouth feel of the broth. Or lam or "o-lam", really is a delicious, traditional dish you could eat every day.</p><p>By the sixth bowl, competitors have begun dropping out. Amateurs, you say to yourself. Pikers. You\'re just getting started.</p><p>The aftertaste of garlic and onion is really building up by the 15th bowl, and the strong chili peppers have made your lips feel numb, and your eyes start to water. This dish isn\'t "western spicy", it\'s just spicy!</p><p>By the 20th bowl, the competition is down to you, and a wiry middle-aged man named Khamgong, who is a veteran eater in these contests. He is skinny, with a thin beard that is now sopping wet with stew, though he doesn\'t seem to notice. He stares at you over the rim of his current bowl, never breaking eye contact.</p><p>Before the match, he was talking all kinds of smack about the other contestants, especially you.</p><p>"That tourist probably had his first bowl of o-lam this morning," he snickered to his toadies.</p><p>"Actually, it was last week," you sniped back, in perfect Vientiane Lao. Looking embarrassed at being caught, Khamgong quickly left the room.</p><p>Now, the two of you are alone at the table, neck-and-neck, through your 25th, 30th, and 40th bowl of or lam. You\'re reeling from the ridiculous quantity of hot stew you\'ve just eaten, and your stomache is rumbling from the effect of the chili peppers.

Now, it comes down to the last man standing. The winner takes the Toyota Hilux, and the loser takes the bus!"</p><p>You dig in to your next bowl with renewed energy. You want that truck! But Khamgong, seeing you not ready to give up, attacks his bowl eagerly, forcing a smile on his face despite the obvious pain he\'s in.</p><p>On the 49th bowl, your body gives out. You can\'t eat another bite. You feel like if you tried, you could injure yourself. You might even die.</p><p>"Discretion is the better part of valor," you say.</p><p>You push your bowl forward, and stand up from the table. "I give in. Khamgong, you win. I guess I\'m just a tourist after all."</p><p>The crowd cheers as Khamgong finishes his bowl, and wipes his mouth. He stares at you, not with a condescending sneer of victory, but with genuine grace and respect.</p><p>"You impressed me today. You\'re not just a tourist, you\'ve got the heart of an or lam champion. I would be proud to eat stew with you any time."</p><p>A couple days later, after the intense stew hangover has passed, he drives you around Luang Prabang in his new red pickup, showing you all the sights, and taking you to his favorite o-lam restaurant — but you stop at one bowl this time!',

He begins smashing the larger ape with his fists. Black Tooth lets go of you, and as you crawl away, gasping, you chance a look behind you and see the two of them fighting, fang and fist.</p><p>The whole pack is soon fighting now, a blood-lust upon them, and their ear-splitting shrieks follow you all the way to the shore, where your kayak is still hidden among the mangrove roots.

But if it's not, then it's whatever has just killed Jorge and his team, and you're about to let it out.</p><p>When he finishes reciting, you hold your breath and unlock the door. It swings open immediately, to reveal three people. They are sweaty, and their clothes are torn, and they look very much the worse for wear. But, they are smiling weakly.</p><p>\"That was a tough job,\" says Jorge. \"A popobawa. The worst kind of Shetani. Very, uhh, violent. Potentially.

This ship isn't going anywhere.</p><p>The radio is another casualty: you pick up the broken pieces of your communications equipment and throw them on the ground in frustration. </p><p>After a few minutes, you begin accept the reality of your situation: you are just another shipwreck on the Skeleton Coast.</p><p>The Skeleton Coast is a 200 kilometer stretch of beach where, due to strong tidal effects, ships that wash up here often can't get back out to sea. It is an inhospital place, often so shrouded in fog that it is hard to see, yet it gets so little precipitation that it is considered a desert: water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. </p><p>No humans live here, but thousands of rusted ships litter the sands, dry and jagged as bones. These skeletal remains give the place its English name, but the name the locals gave it is even more evocative: \"The Land God Made in Anger\". </p><p>After a few days of waiting for rescue, you survey your remaining food and water. It is a meager stockpile, not even enough for two full days of travel. Worried, but determined, you toss it all into a small sack, along with some cinnamon gum and your yellow flashlight, a change of clothes, some matches, and a bottle of sunscreen. </p><p>With mountains to the east, and more of the Namib desert beyond them, the way before you is clear: Swakopomund is a hundred kilometers away, across the soft, arid sands. Throwing the bag over your shoulder, you begin to walk.</p><p>On a beach empty of footprints, you walk all through the night. The full moon hangs above you like a spotlight. You watch crabs skittering across the wet sand, and try to catch some. You succeed only in getting pinched by tiny crab claws, which sends you running away howling in pain.</p><p>The nezt day, with the sun beating down, and the heat climbing to over 100 degrees fahrenheit, you hide in the shade of a large boulder. You take small sips of the warm water through your cracked lips, rationing the water as best you can. Each drop is precious, and with every sip you watch your last liter dwindling down to nothing. </p><p>On the second night, as you are make your way along the coast, you see lights appraching in the distance. These are the headlights of two small quad bikes, driven by men with guns over their shoulders. On the back of the bikes are large, well-secured packages loaded with who-knows-what. Smugglers, taking a risky trip through this no man's land. </p><p>With a cracked, rasping voice, you beg them to take you with them. They glance at the packages they're carrying: \"no room\". Whatever they are carrying, it is more valuable than your life.</p><p>They don't rescue you, but in a gesture of almost miraculous humanity, they do toss you several bottles of water. They look at you with pity as one of the bottles disappears immediately down your parched thoat, then sputter on down the beach and out of earshot. </p><p></\"Thank you!\" you croak after them in a weak, ragged voice.</p><p>On the third day, when your water supply is exhausted again, you hit upon an idea. You decide to sacrifice two of your empty plastic bottles to rig up a contraption that catches the condensation of evaporating seawater. After a long, nervous afternoon of waiting in the hot sun, you manage to almost fill your two remaining bottles, and for the first time are able to drink your fill.</p><p>That night, you devise a method to catch crabs: instead of grabbing them with your fingers, you smash them with a long stick. You harvest a half dozen of the small crabs, and roast them over the fire. Despite the lack of seasoning, they taste delicious. </p><p>After eighteen more days of talking, you stagger into Swakopomund. You are surprised to hear German voices greeting you, but then you remember that Swakopomund is an isolated, former German colonial town, where many people still speak the old language. </p><p></\"Guten tag!\" you call you, waving.</p><p>The locals stare at you. You are filthy, covered in blood from various sources, draped in a hyena pelt, and holding a rusted scimitar and a bag of gems. </p><p>There simply isn't time to explain the pack of hyenas you fought, or ancient Barbary pirate ship you plundered, but to be sure, they were unique and fulfilling adventures that you'll never forget."},

He rises up slowly, obviously frustrated with himself.</p><p>You claim victory in the basketball game, and select a baking competition for the next event. You make some Hwangnambbangg, the delightful, lightly sweetened pastry stuffed with red bean paste. As it melts in his mouth, Kim nods slowly, then begins to smile.</p><p>\"It is among the most perfect things I, or anyone, have ever eaten. You win.\"</p><p>He brings out his own offering, a tray of ice cubes with sugar and red pepper flakes dumped on them. It doesn't look very appealing, and neither of you want to taste it. He admits that he has never cooked for himself before, but asks you to acknowledge that he is a natural chef, who, with even an hour of practice, would certainly become your superior.</p><p>That makes the score three to two, with half the competition over.</p><p>For your next event, you choose a sprinting competition. Leader Kim tips the scales at over three hundred pounds, and looks like he doesn't get a lot of exercise. You line up next to him in the blocks, and when the starter pistol fires, you take an early lead.</p><p>Just as you're about to cross the finish line, you see a dark blur run past you. He looks like a little sausage wearing a black suit, but Kim Jong-un can apparently move when he needs to. He beats you by a full step, and doesn't seem to be out of breath.</p><p>He laughs at you as you try to catch your breath.</p><p>\"Four to two.\"</p><p>He chooses novel writing as the next competition, and easily bests you again. He writes a compelling political allegory about two lovers, swept up in the Korean war, who become freedom fighters and choose to sacrifice their lives to repel an imperialist commando unit at Incheon. It takes you longer to read the novel than it took him to write it, and by the time you have closed the last page he has written a sequel. Both sell a million copies in Pyongyang, and are dramatized as a TV mini-series that is mandatory viewing for all loyal citizens.</p><p>\"Five to two. One more win, and complete victory over the west is at hand,\" he says.</p><p>He chooses golf for the next event. Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, was an excellent golfer, getting 38 under par, with 11 holes in one during his first game ever.</p><p>The match is difficult, but you just barely squeak out a victory, with a score of 25 under par. The younger Kim is not happy with his performance, having only gotten six holes in one. He throws half of his golf clubs in a pond, and bends the rest of them around a telephone pole.</p><p>Five to three, and the final two events are yours to choose.</p><p>You challenge your opponent to a game of chess. He immediately pulls out to a healthy lead, taking a knight and both bishops against your knight. You start playing defensively, but find his aggressive attacks both ingenious and merciless. He beats you back into a tactically disadvantaged position, then closes in for the kill.</p><p>That's when you notice the earpiece he's wearing. \"What's that?\" you say, pointing at it.</p><p>\"This? It's nothing, nothing.\"</p><p>You walk across the room to a nearby closet, fling it open, and discover a chess grandmaster hiding inside it. Not noticing you, he continues is whispering chess moves into a microphone.</p><p>Caught in the act, Kim has no choice but to forfeit the event to you.</p><p>That makes the score five to four, with only one event left. This is it: you can't win, but there may be a way to avoid losing.</p><p>\"For the final event, I choose... nuclear disarmament!\"</p><p>Kim winces, then scowls at you. It is well known that North Korea has been stockpiling nuclear weapons for years, using the threat of global thermonclear warfare in a long-running game of diplomatic brinksmanship against its political adversaries. Much of the North Korean foreign policy playbook centers around threatening to detonate atomic bombs, so the last thing the Supreme Leader want to do is compete to see how many nukes he can disarm.</p><p>You've got him over a barrel. In order to win, he'll have to give up his greatest weapon.</p><p>He sighs, seeing the difficulty of his situation.</p><p>\"I'm afraid I must decline to compete. That leaves our final score at five wins for you, and five for me.\"</p><p>\"A tie!\" you say, nodding vigorously. \"I can live with that.\"</p><p>You extend your hand. He takes it, and gives you a sweaty handshake and a stare that appears just a little bit ominous.</p><p>But you are satisfied. This decathlon was an epic competition, with high stakes.</p><p>For the sake of the millions of oppressed people suffering under his corrupt and repressive regime, you'd have much preferred to win outright. But, you did your best, and have nothing to be ashamed of. Next time!</p><p>That night, North Korean agents kidnap you from your hotel and keep you in a dark cell for days, until U.N. ambassadors successfully negotiate for your release by defeating North Korea's leader at a game of croquet."},

He pleaded to return to the surface, but you reminded him of the contract he'd signed.</p><p>Finally, you had to result to force to keep him at his station.</p><p>\"The captain will be fine,\" you assured him then, rubbing your stinging knuckles.</p><p>You repeat the same words now. The captain is asleep, his breathing regular. He is strapped into his chair to keep him upright, since there's no place to lay him down in the tiny capsule.</p><p> Gravity descends through the bathylpelagic zone, also called the midnight zone because of its sheer, almost uninterrupted blackness. Occasionally, you catch glimpses of bioluminescent through the porthole, like stars hanging in the sky at night. This is the bottom of the sea, past which there is only the abyss.</p><p>  At 5000 meters, you are in the middle of a dead zone in which there is no oxygen to support plant or animal life, and the water hovers just above freezing. The only animals here are invertebrates and certain unusually hardy fish, gluttons for punishment, who can wishstand the 11,000 pounds per square inch of pressure from the overhanging column of water.</p><p>You watch as the alien shape of a jellyfish slides past the window. You see anglerfish, dangling their glowing lures in front of them.</p><p>Suddenly, you see a long shadow cross your field of vision.</p><p>A shadow? Not possible. There's no light down here to cast one!</p><p>Massive, tentacles have wrapped themselves around your craft, obscuring the vehicle's searchlights as they pass in front of them. The submersible creaks and groans as the tentacles constrict it tightly, squeezing with what must be incredible strength. Through the tiny window, you can see that each tentacle is covered with hundreds of suckers.</p><p> A giant squid!</p><p>\"It's pulling us down!\" the pilot screams, wrenching the controls fruitlessly, as though he could use them to steer his way out of a death grip.</p><p> The craft begins to shake violently as the squid spirals downward into the darkness, rolling as it falls like a bullet twisting in the air. You are thrown against the walls, again and again, and feel something in your rib cage crack. The pilot, buckled into his chair, merely emits a continuous scream of terror.</p><p>  \"Orange... switch...\" you hear a voice say. It is the captain, awake, eyes half open.</p><p>  The panicked pilot doesn't seem to have heard the captain, or noticed him, but you manage to crawl across the cabin floor and reach your hand out to just barely touch the smooth orange plastic switch in the middle of the console: \"shock 2\" the label reads. You flip it.</p><p>  A scream reverberates through the capsule, and the squid immediately releases the submersible. It flees upward and away, trailing a cloud of ink darker than the dark water itself.</p><p>  The craft comes to rest on the floor of the ocean. Six thousand meters below sea level is the mouth of hell: Literally, because this area is named after Hades himself. The pressure here is enormous, and life only exists because of the warm, nutrient-rich deep sea vents that spew red-hot toxic gas from the bowels of the earth. This Hadal Zone is found only in nightmares and deep sea trenches, and it was first discovered by a previous expedition to this very part of the ocean.</p><p>When the captain comes around, he explains how giant squid can be a big problem down here, and that deep divers have started adding defenses against them, like the electric field you activated when you threw that switch.</p><p>\"Not enough to kill the beast, but enough to make it think twice.\"</p><p>  \"I thought giant squid were extremely rare,\" you say.</p><p>  \"I wish that were true.\" He sighs, shaking his head. \"No. Ignore what you see on the National Geographic. They're a menace at this depth.\"</p><p> When the inky water has dispersed, you can easily spot your yellow flashlight not far from where you landed. The titanium housing looks like it's held up well to the pressure; even the glass looks to be intact.</p><p>The pilot skillfully retrieves it with the remote-manipulation arms, and you feel a sense of relief to have it back, safe and sound."},

On a whim, you decide it would be fun to hike to the summit of every peak in the Crown, and to do it all in just one day!</p><p>You get an early start, climbing the mount Rysy in the High Tatras. At just over 2500 meters, it is the tallest peak on the list, so it's nice to get it out of the way early. </p><p>Next you hit Wielka Sowa, a much shorter peak in the Owl Mountains. When you get to the summit, you find that contains a concrete and granite structure called a Bismarck Tower! These towers were built in honor of Germany's first chancellor, Otto Von Bismarck, and were used as signal beacons and observatories. You ascend the stairs to the top of the tower and look out over the countryside below: just gorgeous! You snap a photo of yourself, and help some other tourists take snapshots too.</p><p>By the time you make it to the next mountain, Skrzyczne in the Silesian Beskids, it is already late afternoon. This presents a difficulty for your original plan to hike all the mountains in a single day. You realize that you forgot to include travel time in your calculations.</p><p>\"But what really is a day, though, if you stop and think about it?\"</p><p>You decide to change the terms of the challenge a little bit. Instead of defining a \"day\" as a single 24 hour period, you will think of it as the time between waking and sleeping, however long that is. As long as you can stay awake, you tell yourself, <em>my</em> day has not ended. </p><p>You vow to climb the remaining 25 peaks without sleeping.</p><p>The next 6 peaks go by easily. You yawn a bit while summiting the jewel of the Bystrzyckie Mountains, Jogodna, but it only makes you quicken your pace to get the blood flowing. </p><p>Morning comes as you are hiking up Ślęża, a relatively short (700 meter) mountain with a lot of history. The slopes of this granite hill are covered in ruins, and you stop to admire a statue of a bear, carved by ancient Celts untold centuries ago. The bear waves at you and tells you not to give up, and you wave back. </p><p>That afternoon, after crossing a few more mountains off your list, you look around and wonder where you are. You are still walking up a pleasant, grassy slope, but you don't remember which mountain you're on. You seem to have zoned out for a while. You stop some other hikers and ask them the name of the place, and they tell you you're almost to the top of Tarnica, a 1300-meter wonder in the Bieszczady Mountains. </p><p>\"Are you all right?\" they ask, and also \"when is the last time you slept?\"</p><p>You check your watch. </p><p>\"About 38 hours ago, but technically—\"</p><p>You start to tell them about the mission you've set for yourself, but their faces disappear. Soon you realize you've been talking to some bushes growing on the side of the trail. For no clear reason, you apologize for wasting their time, and then continue along the path, shaking your head to try to clear it.</p><p>At midnight, you are climbing the second tallest massif in the Crown, Babia Góra. Ahead of you, you see a bonfire burning, and a group of women cackling and dancing around it. Colorful wisps of smoke rise up from the fire, making strange shapes in the air that move with what seems like a kind of malevolent intelligence. This must be the witches' sabbath, something you've heard about in folk tales associated with this region. </p><p>You pinch yourself, trying to figure out whether it is a hallucination or not. No matter how many times you try to blink away the vision, it is still there when you open your eyes. At last you decide to sneak past it.</p><p>The next day, your feet are almost too heavy to lift as you drag yourself up Łysica, the 28th and final mountain on the list. You saved this one for last on purpose, because at only 600 meters, it is also the shortest mountain by a good margin. You knew you'd be a little tired, and could use a \"gimme\".</p><p>Looking down at your feet, you realize that at some point you must have taken off your shoes. They are nowhere to be found, and by the amount of dried mud on your soles, they might be miles away. You're also wearing an entirely different pair of pants, with no recollection of where you got them. </p><p>\"I sure could use a rest,\" you say. Your eyelids begin to close. </p><p>\"Don't give up, you're almost there!\" says an oddly familiar voice. </p><p>You keep walking, but your eyes are closed now. Does it count as sleep if you never stop hiking?</p><p>\"It's been 60 hours,\" you say, \"I've earned a little nap.\"</p><p>\"Actually, you lost a couple days somewhere in there. It's been almost 90 hours. But look, you made it. You've reached the summit!\"</p><p>Your eyes snap open. Sure enough, there is no more mountain to climb. In fact, you've reached the highest possible point in the  entire Świętokrzyskie range. Looking back down from where you came, you see the trail you've just followed, switchbacking its way down the mountain, back to the nearby village of Święta Katarzyna. In the distance, you see farms, forests, and rivers. Beyond them, dim and hazy, the peaks of other mountains already climbed.</p><p>Beside you stands an older woman, evidently the source of the voice. She tells you her name, and says that she's been following you for the last few peaks, after you told her what you were doing. She was worried about your health. </p><p>\"I kept telling you this was a terrible idea, but you wouldn't give up, so I thought I'd better help you finish.\"</p><p>\"Thank you. But, I have to ask: are you real, or just another hallucination?\"</p><p>She slaps you across the face. It feels real, but it's hard to know for sure anymore. Tears well up in your eyes, both because of her generousity, and because you just realized your journey is actually over. You lay down beside a log and go to sleep, waking in the darkness of the next day to find yourself alone.</p><p>" },

Awakening at sunset, you make your way out to the seaside after dark.

I just like coming back here to watch the waves. It's a nice spot, isn't it?\" </p><p>  In silent agreement, you both stop chatting and turn back to the ocean beneath you. The ceaseless churning of the waves is ancient, primal, powerful. The rhythm has a hypnotic effect, and you lose track of time. </p><p> When you look up again, the ghost of Aleister Crowley has vanished. The moonlight hits the empty pavement where he stood only moments before. He is gone, though perhaps his troubled spirit is finally at rest.</p><p>  But then on the way back to the car, you see him coming out of the restroom, and heading back to the cliff again." },

Seems like everywhere you want to put your hands or feet has a snake there already. They hiss angry warnings at you, but stand their ground.</p><p> Equally stubborn, you continue to climb, not wanting to give up on your dream of reaching the top.

Fortunately, you have been bitten by so many snakes on your trip already that you've developed a fairly strong immunity to most types of snake venom, and are able to proceed, though not without significant discomfort.</p><p> Pico Cão Grande is Portuguese for \"Great Dog Peak\". As you stand at the summit and look out over the jungle, your eyes almost completely swollen shut from the snake bites on your forehead, you wonder where the name comes from. Is it because the remarkably tall, sharply-pointed mountain looks like a dog's tooth? Or, might one of the original discoverers have had a great dog he was commemorating by naming a landmark after it?</p><p> Head aching, and heart racing, you sit down to catch your breath, and stop the world from spinning. </p><p>  The next thing you know, you're waking up in the middle of the night. Initially unsure about where you are, you eventually realize that, in a venom-induced break from reality, you must have climbed a few hundred feet down the almost vertical eastern flank of the mountain. You are now perched on a narrow shelf of rock about eight inches wide, with approximately nine hundred feet of empty space underneath you. The lights of Vila Clotilde wink in the distance, and the larger town of São João dos Angolares can be seen as a glow on the horizon.</p><p>  After a minute or two, you notice that several snakes have their jaws clamped onto you.

Your immunity is very nearly complete, and though you're still feeling feverish and weak, you laugh scornfully at their ongoing attempts to kill you. </p><p> \"On your way, little ones,\" you say, pulling the snakes off your legs and neck, and sending them slinking back into the innumerable cracks and crevices where they make their nests. </p><p> Nonetheless, you do feel tired, and your fingers and toes are still swollen. Keeping that in mind, and allowing some added caution due to the darkness, you decide not to do any more climbing tonight. Lying on your side, you are able to catch a few hours of precarious sleep on the narrow shelf.</p><p>  By the next morning, as the humid mist floats up from the jungle floor, you feel fine. Though eager to get back the rest of your vacation, you are reluctant to start, since it means giving up this incredible view of the island. Ultimately, the rumbling of your hungry belly entices you to get moving, and you are able to resume your descent without further problems. </p><p>  Indeed, the way down is easier than the way up, because you don't need to pay any attention to the snakes, except to admire the beauty of their colorful, scaly skin.

The old building exudes a powerful feeling of shadowy, gothic horror — maybe that's why it has been the setting of so many vampire movies over the years. </p><p>You hear about a new vampire movie filming on location at the castle, and decide to join the cast. After going through multiple rounds of auditions and callbacks, you finally land the part of a minor vampire, a servant of the main vampire (no spoilers, but it's Count Dracula). Your big scene comes near the middle of the picture, when you try to sneak up on the hero and suck his blood while he's chopping vegetables for a stew. </p><p>You creep up behind him, wearing a big black vampire cape. It's somewhat distracting, because instead of being in a regular room, you're on a set, and there are dozens of crew members standing around holding cameras, microphones, lights, and so on. The director sits close by, in a tall, specially designed chair that folds up, so that it can be moved from location to location. The chair has her name on it the back.</p><p>\"Cut!\" the director yells. She seems frustrated, but is trying to remain polite.</p><p>\"Vampire Minion, what's going on? Your sightlines were all over the place.\"</p><p>\"I was looking at the cameras, lighting rigs, and boom microphones,\" you admit. A film set is a fascinating place to be, and you don't want to miss anything.</p><p>\"Just look at Benedict,\" says the director. \"Look at him like you want to bite his neck, because that's what your character wants.\"</p><p>She's talking about Benedict Cumberbatch, the star of the picture. He is playing the hero, a famous vampire hunteer who is visiting the village.</p><p>On the second take, you focus on not being distracted by the film crew. You sneak across the room, toward Benedict Cumberbatch, who is facing away from you, busily chopping vegetables. You have a sinister look on your face, like: \"I'm about to suck your blood, and you don't even know it.\"</p><p>As you approach him, the camera operator pulls focus away from you, toward a closeup of Cumberbatch's hands. He is holding a kitchen knife in one hand, and a carrot in the other. As everybody knows, a sharp knife is no good against a vampire: only a stake through the heart can kill them.</p><p>In an insert shot, we see the hero realize there is someone behind him, then quickly cut the end of the carrot into a sharp point. Then, the camera cuts to an action shot of Cumberbatch whipping around, and driving the sharpened carrot straight into your heart. That part was done by two stunt performers, a week before you arrived on set. The shot of your body turning to stone and shattering into a million pieces of dust was added later, by a digital effects studio in Croatia.  </p><p>After the scene is completed, you are released from set for the day, and go on a tour of the castle. You learn that large parts of the castle had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1800. You also learn that Orava was used as a model for a castle in something called The Witcher.</p><p>Thinking it might help inform his performance, you tell this to the star when you see him walking to his car after shooting has completed. </p><p>\"Not just vampires, but witches too, huh? Pretty wild stuff! Right?\"</p><p>When the movie comes out the next year, you notice that the stew-making scene was removed entirely. In the theatrical cut of the movie, you are only visible in the background of a single shot. You are staring at something off camera, most likely a teamster." },

A cigar smoker's voice, most likely. Older, you'd say late middle age. Educated and commanding. You'd say this is a man used to asking questions.</p><p>\"The <em>Aaron Ward</em> was a U.S. Navy destroyer in WWII. It sank just off the tip of Florida Island, in the Solomons. Japanese dive bombers. February 6, 1943.\"</p><p>\"Very good. You know your history. But do you know about the treasure?\"</p><p>Four days later, you are diving through the murky water of Iron Bottom Sound, graveyard for dozens of war ships and planes from the battle for nearby Guadalcanal. </p><p>You check your air tanks, and find them almost full. You are diving alone, to minimize the number of people who know why you're here. The old man warned you you might be followed, but checked over your shoulder a hundred times, and the coast was clear. Still, you can't shake the feeling of being watched.</p><p> </p><p>Moments later, the large, twisted bulk of the <em>Aaron Ward</em> emerges from the dark water, and you swim inside through a breach in the hull. </p><p>\"My father served on the <em>Ortolan</em>, a minesweeper that helped rescue surivors on the <em>Ward</em>. One of the sailors he couldn't save, a midshipman from Illinois, told him about the treasure as he lay dying.</p><p>\"As water poured into the compartment, the man told him about a certain solid gold crucifix, looted by the Japanese from a Catholic mission on one of the islands, and currently housed on board the sinking ship.\"</p><p>\"How did the crucifix get onto the <em>Aaron Ward</em>?\"</p><p>\"It was... well, let's say it was... re-appropriated. The Japanese officer who stole it no longer had need of it.\"</p><p>\"The Catholic mission, the Japanese officer, and then the sailor who took it. Sounds like this crucifix is bad luck for whoever has it.\"</p><p>\"I don't believe in luck. I believe in the power of money, and that crucifix is worth a lot of it.\"</p><p>You ask why the man's father didn't take the crucifix with him eighty years ago. He laughs, and tells you there is a very good reason for that.</p><p>The light from your cutting torch illuminates the rear section of the ship, casting long, sharp shadows onto the muddy, algae-covered floor. The pressurized cutting medium glows blue-bright, a high-ratio mix of oxygen and acetyene gas burning through steel at over 6000 degrees.</p><p>You had to get a permit to buy this equipment, and take a special course. Most of the other students in the underwater welding course were oil rig or pipeline workers. When asked to introduce yourself to the class, and list a fun fact about yourself, you said \"I'm a treasure hunter, and my favorite fruit is bananas.\"</p><p>Once you've cut all the way through the hinges of the bulkhead door, you are able to pry it open. Eighty years ago, the compartment behind it had filled with water, making it impossible to enter. That water doesn't make any difference to you now, but the years of corrosion had thoroughly stuck the door shut.</p><p>The crucifix is right where the man said it would be, hidden in a crate marked 'crackers'. The wooden box has mostly rotted away, but you can see a glimmer of bright metal inside.</p><p>The crucifix is large, almost a foot long, and very heavy. The gold, and the jewels that decorate it, glint in the light of your headlamp. You feel the weight of it in your hands; not only the weight of the metal, but of the history behind it.</p><p>Movement reflected in the smooth surface. Turning around, you see a knife arcing through the water, in a long swipe that would have cut your air hose. Another diver has followed you into the wreck!</p><p>On pure reflex, you bring the crucifix up to block the attack. The silver of the steel cuts into the soft gold, leaving a deep gouge. </p><p>You fight the attacker across the deck. You manage to crack his breathing mask, forcing him to push away from you and swim to the surface. You use the distraction to escape the wreck, and return to your boat. When you break the surface, your mysterious attacker is gone.</p><p>\"A dangerous job, but worth the risk,\" says the man. \"You did well.\"</p><p>You're meeting him in person for the first time, on his yacht off the coast of Honiara.</p><p>\"Here is your payment,\" he says, handing you a briefcase. You hand him the crucifix, wrapped in cloth.</p><p>\"I'd like to know who tried to kill me,\" you say.</p><p>\"How would I know? You must have let something slip. Did you tell anyone you were hunting for treasure?\"</p><p>His eyes light up as he unwraps the crucifix. You wonder whether the story about his father and the sailor was true. </p><p>\"May it bring you good luck,\" you say.</p><p>Later, in your hotel room, you open the briefcase. It is full of bananas. Nothing but bananas. When you try to track down the man and his yacht, they are gone." },

It is larger even than it seemed from outside, in the sweeping spotlight of the submersible you rode here in. Then, it seemed impressively vast, a cluster of dome structures rising up from the sea floor like a bowl of grapes in a still life. </p><p>Now, it seems like an labyrinth of interconnected chambers, built to a design you cannot piece together from your brief tour. </p><p>You see extensive living quarters, and social areas paneled with wood, stuffed with expensive furniture. Shelves of books, and a billiard table with balls scattered across it as though by walking into this empty room, you'd interrupted a game in progress, and forced its participants to flee out of sight. You almost expect to find them hiding behind a curtain, or in one of the uncountable small alcoves you pass by.</p><p>Your host walks you through more than one full-sized kitchen, commercial-scale, filled with enough equipment to make food for an army. There are bedrooms, too: lavish suites, but also more modest ones, with nothing but a small mattress, dresser, and writing desk. You follow him through a long, narrow room lined with bunkbeds, all crisply made, and unoccupied.</p><p>There are mechanical rooms, and scientific rooms. Rooms filled with massive generators, and humming machinery. Beakers, flasks, centrifuges whirring. Computer displays, both modern ones, and chunky cathrode ray tubes from forty years ago or more. Bays of submersibles, like the one you arrived in. Gymnasiums, squash courts, movie theaters. </p><p>Storage rooms, as large as warehouses, piled with boxes and lined with shelves, all well-stocked and immaculately organized.</p><p>\"This place is enormous,\" you say, stepping out from behind a stack of crates.</p><p>\"Ahh, there you are!\" he says.</p><p>\"I advise you to stay close, it's easy to get lost. You see, the robots have been expanding and improving this facility, on a nearly continual basis, since the late 1990s. That's... 20 years?\"</p><p>\"30 at least,\" you say. </p><p>He smiles ruefully. </p><p>\"Time passes slowly this far down,\" he says, \"but it does pass.\"</p><p>Later, you're sitting in an office. It's a small, round room. Except for the floor, and part of one wall, it is made of a transparent material that makes it seem as though you are standing in a bubble on the floor of the ocean. He is seated across from you, behind a broad desk, messy with papers. </p><p>\"You said this is Conshelf VI. What happened to Conshelves one through five?\"</p><p>\"You're wondering whether it's safe to be here? Whether the sea will swallow us?\"</p><p>His eyes twinkle. </p><p>\"Yes,\" he says, \"it's perfectly safe, I assure you.</p><p>\"The first station was dissembled at my instruction, after the experiment ended. We wanted to test whether it was possible to survive at depth, and we were successful.</p><p>\"Conshelf II is still standing. You passed it on the way down, as a matter of fact! I'm told it is a popular destination for divers visiting the coast of Sudan. Now it is a home for coral, and for the creatures of the deep. </p><p>\"This pleases me greatly: we humans have taken so much from the sea, shall we not let it reclaim something of what is lost?\"</p><p>He pauses for a long time, to stare out the window at a school of blind fish swimming by.</p><p>He continues: </p><p>\"Habitats III and IV were less successful. Our purpose was to stay longer, at even greater depths. We made many breakthroughs, but perhaps we went too far. The blame for both failures is entirely mine.\"</p><p>\"What happened?\" you ask timidly.</p><p>\"What happened was that we learned from our mistakes, and built Conshelf V. That one lasted for four years, at a depth of almost one kilometer! Can you imagine? The effects on the human body, and the brain?</p><p>\"Something unlocks,\" he says. Cryptically, he trails off, leaving an interval of silence before he continues. </p><p>\"Number V was fundamentally sound, and producing giants. Demigods. Bending steel, dreaming in new mathematics, speaking the language of dolphins. A revolutionary success with endless applications.</p><p>\"But the nations of the surface couldn't understand what we were building. So: depth charges,  torpedoes. Earthquakes. They took us by surprise, and cut off our escape. The only way to flee was downward.</p><p>\"Fortunately, we had already started work on Continental Shelf Station VI. It is so deep they have not discovered its existence yet. Naturally, they think I'm dead, that the project is over. But it isn't, wouldn't you agree? And I'm not?\"</p><p>You shake your head. \"But where is everybody? I didn't see a single other person in this whole complex, even though there's probably enough room for a thousand people.\"</p><p>He tells you that he was the only one who survived the attack on Conshelf V. Since then, he has been alone here, unable to recruit more volunteers, for fear of being discovered. </p><p>\"But I very much want to bring more people here, to continue work that can only be done as a group. That's why I was so happy when you contacted me via that electronic messaging system. How did you figure out how to contact me, by the way?\"</p><p>\"Almost by accident,\" you tell himy, shifting your position in the chair.</p><p>\"There was a university research project, monitoring the effects of global warming on the Red Sea. They dropped probes, which happened to monitor electromagnetic signals, among other things. They picked up some unusual signatures, and the people who hired me realized you might have built your latest base near one of your first ones.\"</p><p>\"I see,\" he says, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>As he raises the thin barrel of the pistol, you dive out of the chair, and press the transmitter capsule in your false molar. The sound of his shot is drowned out by the sound of the explosion from the bomb you planted behind the stack of boxes in the warehouse. </p><p>His surprise gives you the opportunity to escape the room, as water begins to flood in from the breach in the hull. You faintly hear him screaming in rage as you sprint down the hallway, toward the submersible bays.</p><p>You plant your remaining micro-charges on all the submersibles except the one you take. You manage to figure out how to open the watertight doors to the station, and speed upwards, toward the sun, as the vast station buckles from the explosions, and collapses under the weight of a million tons of water.</p><p>" },

They're called the Dead Cities, and one of the most impressive is the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites. </p><p>You arrive at the site in the morning, when the air is still cool, and unload your truck full lumber, with a few befuddled tourists looking on.</p><p>Saint Simeon the Stylite was an ascetic hermit who lived in the 5th century. He wandered in the wilderness, contemplating the meaning of the spiritual world, and generally eschewing the ecumenical one. He became so famous for his holiness that people flocked to him, and, in his mind, this defeated the purpose of being a hermit in the first place.</p><p>So, like you're doing today, he built a pillar and climbed up to a small platform on top of it, whereon he could consider the mysteries of the world in peace and quiet. </p><p>His first platform was three meters tall, but evidently that wasn't enough. Crowds continued to throng beneath him, asking him to perform miracles, and teach them the secrets of life, and so on. Multiple emperors even sought his advice, when all he really wanted was some time to think. </p><p>Eventually, Simeon decided to build a second platform, this one 18 meters high. That's a column 60 feet in the air, atop which St. Simeon spent all his days and nights, until his death.</p><p>You complete your own 18-meter pillar by noon, and carefully climb up to the top to eat your lunch. You brought a pita sandwich and some dates, and a can of soda.</p><p>Beneath you, more than a dozen tourists have gathered to take pictures of the hastily-built wooden structure. You dangle your legs over the edge of the platform, and look out at the great sweep of the arid hills around you. </p><p>As you chew your sandwich, you think about the nature of good and evil, and let your mind follow certain paths you'd never considered going down before. It feels, in a way, like being so thoroughly separated from the petty concerns of the world below you has allowed you to operate on a higher plane. Right around the time you swallow your last bite of sandwich, you achieve enlightenment, which elicits a slight belch.</p><p>When Saint Simeon died, the empire commissioned a massive and elaborate church be built on the site. A huge dome was erected around his pillar, like it was a holy object. Though the site was abandoned centuries later, pilgrims continued to visit the church, and chip away fragments of the pillar as keepsakes. Slowly, Simeon's pillar was worn down to a nub and scattered to hundreds of reliquaries and private collections all over the world. </p><p>In the early afternoon, police from Aleppo arrive and force you down off your pillar. You watch from the ground as the wooden pillar is cut down by a police chainsaw (it's a a chainsaw with the logo of the Aleppo police on it: what would you call it?) The debris is loaded into a dumptruck, and taken to the dump.</p><p>The subject of arrest and jail time is broached. Using your newly-acquired enlightened wisdom, you impress the chief of police enough that he lets you off with a fine, and a stern warning. Later that evening, the enlightenment wears off."},

It\'s Ted!</p><p>He apologizes for being in such a "snippy" mood the other day, and you apologize for asking him "giant questions" he is probably tired of answering.
