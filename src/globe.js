          'The first cable was laid across the Atlantic in 1858. It only lasted a couple of weeks before breaking down, but that was enough to plant the idea of instantaneous global communication. Today, there are about a dozen transatlantic cables, relaying hundreds of terabits of information every second.</p><p>Whereas the first telegraph cable carried only a stilted, formal exchange between Queen Victoria of England, and President James Buchanan of the United States, modern cables carry everything from pornography, to unboxing videos, to vape trick videos, and even NFTs. Every piece of DLC downloaded in Fortnite, every unwanted piece of email spam, every ill-informed tirade on Twitter: those ideas all started right here, with this cable.</p><p>Well, strictly speaking, there is no cable here anymore. The original cable was removed after it broke in the 1850s.</p><p>But, the route remains, and it is as important to the history of our noble species as the ancient migration out of Africa, or the path Apollo 11 took from the Earth to the moon.<p>That is why you are in a rowboat, about 1500 kilometers east of Heart\'s Content, Newfoundland, and about the same distance from Valentia Island, in Ireland. These are the terminal points for the original transatlantic telegraph. You have decided it would be fun and meaningful to re-enact the journey a bit of information would have taken, but in an open-topped row boat.</p><p>A storm on the second day overturned the boat, and you lost most of your supplies, but were able to right the ship and even retrieve one of the oars. By paddling for a few minutes on one side of the boat, then swapping the oar to the other side and paddling the same number of strokes, you manage to maintain a relatively straight line, on a compass bearing which puts you about two miles above the seafloor where the cable used to be, over 170 years ago.</p><p>It\'s hard work, rowing this boat. Fortunately, there is plenty of salty water, fish, and seaweed to prepare, and the sharks mostly leave you alone. As you row, you think about all the data that would be zipping around right underneath you, if the transatlantic telegraph cable was still operational. What telegraph would you send right now, if you could? Maybe "Help", or even just "SOS".</p><p>What an amazing voyage, and it\'s only halfway done!</p>',

You feel an impulse of nervousness, and if you didn't have an audience, you wonder whether you'd go through with this crazy stunt.</p><p>\"Reverse 4½ somersault, pike position\" you call out. This dive would earn you a medal at the Olympics if you pulled it off there, but right now you'd be satisfied with just not embarassing yourself in front of the locals.</p><p>You turn around, get into position, and take a blind leap backward off the bridge, pulling your legs in and turning through the air.

The water is cold, and murky, and you extend an arm expecting to touch the bottom, but never do.</p><p>When you emerge downstream, people are still on their feet, cheering and calling out your name.</p><p>The mayor shows up to help haul you out of the water. He is wearing a suit, and even has a sash that says 'mayor' in Serbian. He invites you to tour the city, and you shake a lot of hands. The people who saw your dive praise you, and the people who weren't there express the deepest regret that they missed it.</p><p>The mayor offers to build a statue in your honor, but you decline. \"It was just a dive,\" you say modestly, \"gravity did all the work.\"</p>Instead, they give you a plaque.</p>",

I see how people look at you when you walk into a room. That\'s what I want too."</p>Your memory flashes back to yesterday night, at the restaurant in Gaborone. The way the manager deferred to him.

For instance, this water is seasonal; in a month it will be gone. So they must know when they can count on it, and when they cannot. And then there are predators: Lions, jackals, hyenas.

That perfect smile again.</p><p>"I guess you always have to be on guard for that kind of thing, I suppose. Night and day. Protecting your wealth must be a lot of work."</p><p>He slaps you on the shoulder. "This is what I was trying to tell you. There\'s no end to the work! I envy your freedom, my friend.

Without a moment\'s hesitation, you buy a copy and sit down on the curb to read it:</p><p><blockquote><h4>The Case of the Falling Body</h4><p><cite>By R. W. Trounce</cite></p>Inspector Piggsbed was called to the scene of the accident. Or, shall we say, the scene of the crime, for he would not have been called to a field in Dumpleshire at 6 o\'clock in the morning — before he\'d even had his tea — if somebody had not suspected foul play.</p><p>The field was empty, save for a few distant, indolent cows, watching the busy police disrupt the quietude of their bucolic home.</p><p>The deceased (male, mid-twenties) was dressed in a khaki colored jumpsuit, now muddy from the wet ground upon which he lay. He had an empty backpack strapped to his torso, its single compartment opened at the top. He also wore a helmet, which was cracked and splintered, as was the head it contained.</p><p>"Looks like he died on impact, Inspector. Impact from a great height..." the medical examiner made a sound that started quietly, and rose steadily in volume, as he mimicked someone falling from the sky. "shooooOOOOOOOOO.... SPLAT! Ha ha!"</p><p>"I\'ll thank you to show some decorum, officer. This is no laughing matter, a man has died."</p><p>The ME lowered his head, chastened, and waited for the inspector to continue.</p><p>"It appears this unfortunate man died after jumping out of an airplane. Or being pushed. At any rate, the parachute he dependent upon to slow his descent failed to do so. I believe I know how it happened, and who the murderer is."</p><p>The other officers were astonished at this, though their long history of working with the famous Inspector Piggsbed should have taught them that swift and seemingly incredible deductions of this kind were altogether commonplace whenever that brilliant detective was in play.</p><p>"But how could you know?" said a fat Sergeant, his mouth agape.</p><p>"Quite simple really. All the clues are here, before you. Nothing is hidden from view."</p><p>He turned to the cheeky Medical Examiner and said, with an almost undetectable trace of smugness in his voice: "Can you solve this riddle?"</p></blockquote><p>"No!" you say out loud. "You don\'t have Inspector Piggsbed\'s brilliant intellect, or his nose for justice!"</p><p>You continue on to the solution, eager to learn how it played out:</p><p><blockquote>The inspector noticed that no parachute was visible. He thus concluded that the man\'s normal parachute had been replaced by an ice parachute (that is, a parachute made out of ice instead of nylon). Instead of slowing his fall, the brittle ice parachute shattered shortly after being deployed, and the man fell to the ground, dead. The ice fell too, and then melted, explaining the muddy ground beneath the victim\'s body.</p><p>This left only one question: who was the murderer? Who packed the fatal parachute?</p><p>"Quite simple," said Piggsbed, secretly enjoying having a rapt audience hanging on his every word.</p><p>"It is a principle of criminal psychology that the murderer is always drawn to return to the scene of the crime. Officer, I think we should interrogate those cows watching us right now..."</p><p>At that, one of the cows (a spotted one) began running awkwardly toward a nearby copse of trees by the motorway. As it ran, only its front legs seemed to move, and eventually it stumbled and fell to the ground in a tangled mass.</p><p>When the police caught up to it, it turned out the "cow" was really a man wearing a cow suit in order to blend in to the scenery and avoid suspicion. Upon questioning, he turned out to be the victim\'s mortal enemy, and quickly confessed to his heinous crime.</p><p>He was convicted, and sentenced to the stiffest possible penalty under Her Majesty\'s law: four months in prison, and a written apology to the farmer who owned the field.</p></blockquote><p></p>You close the book, and sigh with pleasure:  Piggsbed always gets his man!</p>',

          'One morning, you hear a knock on your hotel room door. When you open it, in your bathrobe, there\'s nobody in the hallway. But, there is a basket on the floor.</p><p>You pick it up and look inside. You are surprised to see that it contains a large frog. A very large frog.</p><p>"I believe it\'s a Goliath frog," the concierge tells you, when you bring the basket to him and ask for help. "It\'s the largest species in the world. They\'re native to Equatorial Guinea."<p></p>"It looks like there is a card in the basket, have you read it yet?"</p><p>The concierge saw what you, in your surprise, had missed.</p><p>You carefully pick up the small piece of heavy card stock, which one the frog\'s front legs is pinning to the bottom of the basket. The frog looks unperturbed, blinking its huge, wet eyes impassively.</p><p>In a hand-written script, the card reads: my name is Frederick, please follow me.</p><p>At that, the massive frog, which looks to be at least a foot long, hops out of the basket and across the lobby of the hotel. It waits in front of the door for you to follow. You almost expect it to turn around and tell you to hurry up.</p><p>You follow it through the streets of Bata, the city where you\'re staying at present. It seems to know where it\'s going, casually hopping through the streets. Rather than trying to jump across busy intersections, like the frog in the video game, this one stops to wait for traffic to pass before safely proceeding. Many people watch the strange sight, laughing or asking each other if they\'ve ever seen anything like it. They all agree that it\'s at least a little unusual to see a 3 kilogram frog leading a tourist with such confidence and sense of purpose.</p><p>Twenty minutes or so later, you arrive at a nice, but ordinary looking house near the harbor. Frederick, which you take for granted is the frog\'s given name, hops into the house through the open door. Hesitating only a moment, you follow it inside.</p><p>A man is waiting for you in the living room, sitting in an armchair, with the frog in his lap. He is middle-aged, with close-cropped, curly hair. He is wearing glasses, and a tan linen shirt and blue jacket, and gives off the air of a teacher, or professor, or a scholar.</p><p>He smiles at you. "Thank you for humoring me, I understand my invitation was a little unorthodox. I asked Frederick to bring you here because I need your help."</p><p>The man, whose name turns out to be Francisco, explains that he has been training Goliath frogs to act as companion animals for the elderly and disabled. But, a shadowy criminal organization got word of his research, and kidnapped most of his, as he calls them, \'students\'. Only Frederick, who was out of the house on an errand at the time, was spared.</p><p>"They will use them as thieves, spies, even assassins. I cannot allow my work to be used for evil. I have heard you are an adventurer, and so I beg you to bring them back, and put a stop to these men once and for all."</p><p>His honest eyes are pleading.</p><p>"I\'ll do it," you say.</p><p>48 hours later, you have wrapped up the case. You managed to track down the criminal organization, which it turned out was tied to all the recent jewel thefts in Equatorial Guinea. They were holding the trained Goliath frogs in a swamp in the Sanaga basin.</p><p>You sadly inform Francisco that his star pupil, Frederick the frog, had been working with the thieves all along, including in the plot to kidnap the other frogs. You and Frederick had had a showdown in a helicopter hangar, and only one of you had walked (not hopped) away.</p><p>Francisco is quiet, but nods his head.</p><p>"I understand," he says. "Maybe I pushed him too hard. Maybe I pushed them all too hard. Maybe... maybe the world isn\'t ready for this technology."<p></p>You convince him to continue his research, then return, alone, to your hotel room.</p>',

          "This massive fortress on top of a steep mountain was built by former slaves after Haiti's revolution for independence.</p><p>Surrounded on all sides by almost unclimbable slopes, and with its one safe approach covered by a colossal enfilading wall, Laferrière was designed to be impregnable. Even if the front gate were left open, an attacker marching up the road would be killed a dozen times by arrows, guns, or even rocks thrown from the high walls. Sure enough, the citadel has never been breached.</p><p>Sounds like a challenge!</p><p>The rampart at the rear of the complex is tall, round, and perched at the edge of a cliff. This makes it not only nearly impossible to climb, but extremely dangerous to even attempt. The Haitian defenders knew there's no way an invading army could get a commando unit inside the citadel that way, and that makes it the perfect way to get inside.</p><p>That's why, on a moonless night, dressed in black, you find yourself picking your way up the outside of the cylindrical tower. Your progress is achingly slow, because the slightest mistake would result in you falling to your certain death. Your broken body would be swallowed by the mountain's thorny undergrowth, never to be found.</p><p>Halfway up the rampart, the muscles in your hands feel like they're on fire with the effort, and you start to feel like giving up. \"Why am I even doing this?\" you ask yourself.</p><p>You have no answer.</p><p>In fact, you feel like calling it quits, and coming back during the day, when the citadel is open to the public. Rather than taking an incredible risk with dubious rewards, you could be back in your hotel in an hour, having a good night's rest, then a nice breakfast in the morning. You'd come back in the afternoon, walk around at a leisurely pace. You'd see everything, talk to some people, even buy a souvenir. Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p><p>Just then, you realize you've reached the top. You pull yourself over the lip of the rampart, and collapse with exhaustion. You were so scared on the way up that you almost cry with relief to be on flat ground again, not digging your fingernails into mortar while hanging over an abyss.</p><p>When you catch your breath, you stagger weakly to your feet and look around.</p><p>You can't see much due to the lack of light. There are some cannonballs across the courtyard, but it's too dark to make out much detail. Not that it would matter: if you've seen one cannonball — which you already have — you've pretty much seen them all.</p><p>You find that the doors to the interior of the citadel are locked, and you can't see through the windows, because it's as dark inside as out. Too bad, you think, there's probably some neat historical artifacts in there.</p><p>You snap a few pictures, but they're blurry and indistinct, even with the flash on.</p><p>You shuffle into your hotel room just before dawn, shaking, covered with dirt and blood, and fall into a dead sleep with your clothes still on. Later, you are arrested for trespassing.</p><p>But: Mission accomplished! After 200 years, La Citadelle Laferrière has been infiltrated at last.</p>",

It\'s surrounded by Dragons, but so far the walls are holding. For how long, I don\'t know. I stayed behind to warn you not to land on the island, but it looks like I was too late."</p><p>"Let\'s hope not," you say, staring grimly into the middle distance.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, you are standing in the back of a speeding pickup truck, tossing chunks of goat meat into the mouths of a hoard of ravenous Komodo Dragons as they chase the vehicle away from the supply warehouse.</p><p>The truck bounces over the rutted, muddy roads on the island, and you are almost thrown from the vehicle more than once. You shudder to think of what would happen if you lost your footing and fell into that feeding frenzy.</p><p>In the distance, you see the door of the warehouse open. People begin tentatively poking their heads out, checking to see that all the Komodo Dragons have left.</p><p>Satisfied that they\'re out of danger for the moment, they run to the docks, and on to the waiting Coast Guard vessels. Soldiers standing behind mounted machine guns sweep the area, wary of any Komodo Dragons that didn\'t take the bait. Once everyone is on board, they gun the engines and point the ships out to the safety of deep water.</p><p>"Looks like your diversion worked," says your host, later.</p><p>The two of you are sitting on the veranda of the visitor\'s center, looking out over the jungle. You can see a couple of Komodo Dragons: lazy, fat, basking in the evening sun, looking almost gentle now that they\'re well fed.</p><p>You nod. "There\'s just one thing I don\'t understand. You said you couldn\'t feed the dragons because the power went out. What stopped you?"</p><p>He looks a little bit embarrassed. After a minute, he shrugs his shoulders and admits:</p><p>"My alarm didn\'t go off!"</p><p>You look at him angrily, then, after a beat, you both start to laugh uncontrollably.</p>',

Hungry and tired from a full day of walking, you almost walked right by the  flaming swords, but just happened to look up at the last second and notice them.</p><p>It's a good thing you did, or all that work would have been for nothing! Satisfied, you sit down next to a cold, clear spring and look around you. You would describe the garden of eden as: very green, with lots of flowers and trees with ripe fruit. You pick some, and bite into it with relish. You wonder why anyone would want to leave such a nice garden, and resolve to read more about it later.</p><p>You talk to a friendly snake for a while, then excuse yourself to head back to your hotel.

He's been spinning yarns that seamlessly blend legends from Celtic folklore with old gossip from around town, with bits from the history of Ireland, and more than a few off-color jokes thrown in. Not only is he utterly charming, warm, and voluble, he's exactly the kind of character you'd hoped to meet on this trip to Ireland.</p><p>\"Patrick, you've certainly got the gift of gab. You must have kissed the Blarney Stone,\" you say, chuckling at his tall tales.</p><p>He smiles, and there is a twinkle in his eye.</p><p>\"Oh! So you've heard about the Blarney Stone, have you? That tourist trap at Castle Blarney that's supposed to have the fairy magic? No, no. That's just an old wive's tale. Put it out of your mind, says I.\"</p><p>He leans back, puffing on his pipe thoughtfully. After a moment, it seems as if he has a idea, which he dismisses, then reconsiders. At last, he looks around him to make sure there is no one else listening, and leans toward you, conspiratorially.</p><p>\"Mind you, there's a measure of truth to the tale, as I myself am proof of. But the Stone isn't that pebble they keep in Blarney.\" He shakes his head gravely. \"No, the real genuine article, the one the stories are referrin' to, is at Iniscarra, near where I was born.\"</p><p>He offers to take you to see this magical stone, so of course you take him up on the offer. By kissing the real Blarney Stone, you hope to gain the ability to charmingly deceive people, and spin an entertaining yarn like Patrick. For an unemployed drifter such as yourself, it seems like a useful skill to have.</p><p>The next morning, after paying Patrick's tab at the local pub, and giving him several hundred dollars for his time, and buying him a watch, you drive out to a field near a lazily winding river. You expect to see a town here, or at least a quaint Irish village. But here, there is nothing but some old ruins, on a small hill just above the river.</p><p>Patrick looks wistfully at the landscape, as though remembering something he'd put out of his mind. </p><p>\"A long time before you were born, there was an old monastery here. St. Senan's it was called.\"</p><p>He gestures toward the ruins and the green-black water beyond it.</p><p>\"Hydro-electric dam project raised the river level. Drowned the monastery, and all the farms. All that was spared were a few tumbledown buildings, and a little graveyard, and that smooth stone yonder, around which you can sometimes glimpse the fair folk dancing in the full moon's light.\"</p><p>He points an aged finger at an ordinary looking boulder close to the river bank. Despite its unremarkable apparance, this must be the true Blarney Stone!</p><p>You approach it, kneel down in front of it. Gingerly, you give it a little kiss, and feel an almost electric charge run down your spine, from your lips to your toes.</p><p>\"Did it work?\" you ask, excitedly.</p><p>\"Of course it worked,\" says Patrick, \"it never fails! Now, we'd better be going back to town while the bank is open. I'll be needing to deposit this money you kindly lent me.\"</p><p>He begins walking toward the car, smoking his pipe and twirling his hand-carved walking stick happily.</p><p>\"And after we've finished our business, we'll head to the pub, and I'll let you buy me another drink or three!\" he says, giving you a wink.

You give it a little wave. </p><p>It seems you were just a temporary distraction from its real genda: eating the leaves that grow on the branches of the tree outside your window. It backs out the window and returns to its breakfast, having satisfied all its curiousity about you when it realized you had no treats to give out. </p><p>You stand at the window and look out. This giraffe is not alone: there are two others working the nearby acacia trees. In the distance, you can see even more, drinking from a watering hole, or just standing around majestically in the golden light of the Kenyan morning.</p><p>You step up on the windowsill, and hop over to the acacia tree. Climbing up to the tallest branch, beyond the reach of even the giraffe\'s prodigious neck, you pull out fistfuls of the leaves. You assume that the leaves that grow out of reach of the giraffe are probably the most delicious leaves anyway, and that the friendly creature will appreciate them.</p><p>Holding the leaves against your chest with in one hand, you carefully make your way out to the end of a long branch. The branch seems a little thin, but is holding your weight so far. You look down at the ground, 25 feet below. It looks hard.</p><p>The giraffe steps back to watch you. It must be thinking you are a very strange creature.  But, since you are carrying some of the sweet, forbidden upper treetop leaves, it wonders if perhaps you will feed it some of them. Here at Giraffe Manor, giraffes are used to being hand fed by the humans stay here, it seems like a distinct possibility. The giraffe waits, patiently.</p><p>You wrap your legs tightly around the branch, working your way further out toward the ever-narrowing end. The branch is dipping now, under your weight. You extend your arm out as far as you can, offering some of the leaves to the creature. </p><p>It cranes its neck, and reaches out with its long tongue — well over a foot long — and delicately plucks the leaves out of your hand. Its tongue is wet, and warm, and a little digusting. You watch it munch the leaves happily.</p><p>As you reach for another handful of leaves, you hear a snap and are suddenly falling. The branch has broken! You cry out in surprise as the ground rushes up to meet you, and close your eyes. A fall from that height will surely be fatal. So long, cruel world.</p><p>When you open your eyes again, you are floating in the air, suspended by the collar of your pajamas. The giraffe has caught you in its mouth! It lowers you safely to the ground, and you feed it the rest of the leaves.</p>',

Rugged limestone walls rise 300 meters on each side, blocking your escape, while providing a perfect field of fire for the anonymous marksman.</p><p>As bullets ping off the rocks next to your head, you run in a serpentine pattern, zig-zagging down the trail. The steep sides of the canyon mean there is nowhere to go but forward, or back the way you came, but you know that somewhere ahead of you is the mouth of a cave system called Gryka e Madhe.</p><p>Just as the cave comes into view, you trip on the uneven ground and fall hard onto your face. You feel the impact of the bullet, followed instantaneously by the report, and its echo off the hard canyon walls.</p><p>Warm liquid runs down your back: is it blood? As the hunter reloads, you pick yourself up and surge through the dark entrance to the cave.</p><p>Gryka e Madhe is a large cave system in Rugova, with many kilometers of unexplored tunnels, on at least five separate levels. A paradise for spelunkers, and a dangerous place to get lost.</p><p>You examine yourself for wounds, but find that apart from a few scrapes, you are unharmed. Your empty canteen has two large, sharply-defined holes on either side, where a rifle round has passed cleanly through.</p><p>You find a dark corner a few hundred meters in. You crouch, listening carefully. Now that your water is gone, you suddenly find yourself thirstier than you've ever been in your life. Even if you survive this encounter, you've still got to hike out of the canyon without any water. That would be a nice problem to have, you decide.</p><p>After an hour, you hear the crunch of gravel under boots. Only one set of them. Someone has followed you into the cave, and you have to assume it's the same person who attacked you. Their flashlight beam grows larger as they approach, illuminating your small chamber, which suddenly doesn't seem like such a great hiding spot after all.</p><p>You are holding a rock the size of a softball in your hands.</p><p>When the hunter gets close enough, you leap out and smash them with the rock. Staggered, he swings the rifle barrel toward you, but in the tight chamber it glances off the ceiling, and he is unable to line up his shot before you tackle him.</p><p>As the two of you fall to the ground, he pulls the trigger in desperation, briefly lighting up the entire room, and deafening you both with a terrific bang.</p><p>The two of you struggle on the ground, until your attacker pulls out a knife, and takes wild swings at you with it.</p><p>After avoiding most of his attacks, you eventually wrench the knife from his hands and turn it on him. As you sink it into his chest, he snarls something at you that you can't make out due to the ringing in your ears. You drive the knife down with all your weight and stay on top of it until he stops thrashing.</p><p>The dead man is older than you'd have guessed: in his late fifties, but still in good shape. He's not carrying an ID, but he shouldn't be hard to identify: he is missing a finger, and he has one gold tooth, and one blackened one. You take his canteen and drink thirstily from it, discovering it is full of disgusting, cold coffee.</p><p>\"Who was he?\" you ask the police detective back in Peja that evening. You're relieved that your hearing has mostly returned already.</p><p>The detective stares at you, like he can't decide what to say. \"He was my brother.\"</p><p>After a long pause that contains a lifetime of sadness in it, he adds only this: \"He was a very troubled man.\"</p><p>Huh. Well, that was unexpected!</p><p>After an investigation, you are released from police custody and allowed to resume your hike through beautiful, wild Rugova Canyon!</p>",

You can\'t eat another bite. You feel like if you tried, you could injure yourself. You might even die.</p><p>"Discretion is the better part of valor," you say.</p><p>You push your bowl forward, and stand up from the table. "I give in. Khamgong, you win. I guess I\'m just a tourist after all."</p><p>The crowd cheers as Khamgong finishes his bowl, and wipes his mouth. He stares at you, not with a condescending sneer of victory, but with genuine grace and respect.</p><p>"You impressed me today. You\'re not just a tourist, you\'ve got the heart of an or lam champion. I would be proud to eat stew with you any time."</p><p>A couple days later, after the intense stew hangover has passed, he drives you around Luang Prabang in his new red pickup, showing you all the sights, and taking you to his favorite o-lam restaurant — but you stop at one bowl this time!',

You know that this fight is not only for alpha status in the pack, but for survival: the winner takes all.</p><p>You came to this so-called \"Monkey Island\" island yesterday, despite warnings from the locals that it wasn't safe. You knew that a group of chimpanzees, formerly unwilling medical research subjects, had been brought to live here after the project lost its funding. The water surrounding the island forms a natural barrier, a kind of prison to keep the angry apes from migrating to the outside world. They warned you that the chimps could get violent, and had been known to attack human tourists. Now, you wish you'd heeded that warning.</p><p>Black Tooth, their leader, is unusually tall and muscular. The survivor of many such fights, he has maintained dominance over his \"kingdom\" by strength and cunning, defeating all usurpers, and making an example of interlopers like yourself.</p><p>You dance out of reach of Black Tooth's long arms, and then execute a counter attack, bringing the side of your palm down on the back of his neck as you pass behind him. The ape's thickly corded muscles are like iron: he barely notices your strike.</p><p>The rest of the chimpanzees scream in excitement as their leader wheels around and grabs hold of you. His grip is inescapable, far stronger than that of any human. He grins at you malevolently, revealing the dead, dark blue canine tooth from which he takes his name.</p><p>Your arms are pinned to your side, and despite your struggling, Black Tooth is too strong for you to struggle free. You feel the very breath being pressed from your lungs, as though you were being squashed you like an aluminum. As you fade into unconsciousness, your vision begins to darken into a narrow tunnel.</p><p>That's when you see a glint in the eye of Flat Nose, the pack's second-in-command. When they captured you earlier, you could sense some tension between Black Tooth and his lieutenant. Now, Flat Nose is staring at you, with a hopeful look on his face. In your increasingly foggy brain, it seems like this chimpanzee is trying to tell you something.</p><p>Summoning your last ounce of strength, you use your superior height to lift Black Tooth completely off the ground. Arms still holding you like a vice, you stagger to the other side of the rough circle of apes, carrying your enemy with you. You fall forward, straight into Flat Nose, and the three of you land in a heap on the ground.</p><p>With Black Tooth distracted, Flat Nose takes his opportunity to betray his cruel king. He begins smashing the larger ape with his fists. Black Tooth lets go of you, and as you crawl away, gasping, you chance a look behind you and see the two of them fighting, fang and fist.</p><p>The whole pack is soon fighting now, a blood-lust upon them, and their ear-splitting shrieks follow you all the way to the shore, where your kayak is still hidden among the mangrove roots. Their calls follow you for some time as you paddle away, hurriedly, and then give way to a call of triumph. Perhaps Black Tooth has once again put down his rival, or perhaps, tonight Monkey Island has crowned a new king.",

          "At 417 meters tall, the Omega Tower in Paynesville, Liberia was the largest structure ever built in Africa. It was a steel radio tower, erected by the United States as part of a network of 8 gigantic Omega Towers around the world, whose purpose was to broadcast signals to help planes, ships, and submarines navigate before GPS satellites.</p><p>This Omega Tower was supposed to have been torn down in 2011, with a marketplace built in its footprint. As you are wandering through that marketplace on a windy morning, you are quite surprised to see that the tower is still standing!</p><p>Shoppers, jostling through the busy bazaar, flow around its four thick stanchions, which are still planted in the middle of the street. One stall, hawking knock-off leather goods, is even built so that part of its back wall is the tower's concrete footing, which acts as a display rack for inexpensive purses.</p><p>Despite rumors of its demise, it seems the Paynesville Omega Tower still soars above the city, like a needle piercing the clouds!</p><p>Energized by this unexpected good luck, you decide to climb up the tower's steel skeleton, strut by strut, until you stand at the top and look down on the city of Paynesville, and the nearby metropolis of Monrovia.</p><p>You can see Wood Town, and Jacob Town, and the long, white strip of Bernard's Beach. Your eyes follow the St. Paul river upstream to its source in the mountains of Guinea, far to the east. The low-slung cities here are like grey patches on the soft, emerald velvet forest stretching backward to the horizon.</p><p>A gust of wind catches your extremely baggy pants, and knocks you off the tower. You fall 1300 feet down, ready to meet your certain doom, but wake up just before hitting the ground.</p><p>Thankfully, it was just a dream! When you open your eyes, you find that you have been sleeping under an awning in the market, and the Omega Tower is nowhere to be seen. In your mind, it's as though it has just vanished, though in reality you know it has been gone for many years.",

Now, the former iron pit mine is called Bomi Blue Lake, and it supports abundant trees, wildlife, and a growing tourist trade.</p><p>"That\'s the problem, you see," says your new friend, a young man named Moses.</p><p>He is dressed in a white shirt and blue jeans, wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap: he has never been to California, but he says he likes the logo.</p><p>"The problem is that this snake is scaring away all the tourists!"</p><p>It is true that some cattle which grazed the shores of the lake have disappeared, recently. What\'s worse, there are rumors of missing people, too.</p><p>Moses says there is a giant snake that swims up from deepest part of the lake. The most chilling rumor about it is that this snake is really the spirit of one of the miners who used to work the iron pit mine, and died in in a catastrophic accident. </p><p>"Why would the miner come back as a snake and scare away tourists?" you ask. What could possibly motivate him to do that?</p><p>"Ghosts do not reason like you and I would," Moses says sagely. Fair point.</p><p>You agree to hunt for the snake. As a tourist in Liberia, you are the perfect candidate to track down dangerous serpents and vengeful ghosts, because you have nothing else to do.</p><p>At midnight, crouched on the shores of Bomi Blue Lake, you see a writhing shape move across the sapphire waters. It approaches the shore, only twenty or so meters from where you are hidden. You see its long tail swishing lazily as it makes its way onto dry land.</p><p>This snake has its eyes set on the cow you have tied to a post, which you are using as bait to trap it. It moves toward it, on four short legs. Its long snout is full of yellow, knifelike teeth, which gleam in the moonlight when it opens wide to chomp down on the ... </p><p>"Wait a minute, you aren\'t a serpent at all! You\'re a crocodile!"</p><p>As your net drops over the beast, you leap out of cover to secure it. You drag the frustrated, thrashing reptile back to Moses\' garage, and carefully push it into a cage he\'s already built for this purpose.</p><p>"Who knows how it got here," you say, shrugging your shoulders. "The point is, there\'s no serpent, and no ghost. Just a hungry freshwater crocodile that\'s been getting fat on your cattle."</p><p>After releasing the crocodile into its natural habitat, all the missing people from the local villages show up again: turns out they didn\'t get eaten, they\'d been on a secret vacation they didn\'t tell anybody about.</p>Everything worked out great in the end, and you enjoyed the rest of your vacation at Bomi Blue Lake.

Oil is smeared on the inside of the pan, and you are told that the midges will stick to it. All you've got to do is swipe the pan around a few times as you pass through the cloud of flies, and then scrape the resulting mass into a bucket. Easy as pie.</p><p>\"We're going right into the bugs?\" you ask.</p><p>They nod. \"Not right in the middle, but close enough.

          'You are deep below the earth in the Clearwater Cave System, a massive series of interconnected chambers that have been actively explored for almost fifty years, and are still yielding new discoveries. </p><p>You\'re with a group of experienced speleologists, sitting in an unnamed cave the size of an airplane hangar. The air here is clean, but still.</p><p>A small stream of water trickles through the center of the cave, burbling past your camp and disappearing into the infinite darkness beyond, through a thousand cracks in the stone. A forest of stalagmites and alien-looking mineral formations surrounds you, some of them hatched with irridescent veins that glitter in the beam of your headlamp, and seem to hold that light for a moment afterward.  </p><p>"What\'s the strangest thing you\'ve seen while exploring?" you ask.</p><p>The explorers look at each other, each waiting for the next to speak up first. Finally one of them does.</p><p>"I was mapping a new portion of Blue Moonlight Bay cave. It was kind of deep, maybe over 500 meters. I had to crawl through a low passage, and I noticed that there wasn\'t a lot of dust on the floor. You could see the bare rock, which is unusual because there\'s usually a layer of dust in those areas.</p><p>"So that was weird, but nothing to write home about. </p><p>"But then, I went around a corner, and saw something I never expected. A small door set into the wall. When I say small, I mean maybe less than a meter tall. It was made of metal. There was light — very faint light — coming from under it."</p><p>"Who made the door?" you ask.</p><p>He throws both hands up, grinning. "I don\'t know. I got out of there as fast as I could. Never went back. As far as I know, that section of the cave is still unexplored, and I\'m the only person who\'d ever been down there.</p><p>He emphasizes the word \'person\'.</p><p>"So I\'ll never know. Who made the door? Where was the light coming from? I\'m not sure I want to know who the answer to those questions."</p><p>Another in the group nods, and volunteers his own story.</p><p>"I saw some carvings. Well, engravings, really. A whole wall of a cavern in the Benarat system. Probably ten meters long, carved into the stone by hand tools. I found some of the tools on the floor: they looked old, that\'s all I can say.</p><p>"Anyway, the pictures told a story. From what I gathered, it was about a city that was swallowed by the earth. The people in it tried to find their way back to the surface, but they couldn\'t. So, they learned how to live down there. They found food, water. Over time, they learned how to see in the dark well enough.</p><p>"At the end of the story, there were only a few of them that even remembered their ancestors used to live under the sun. That group made the carvings, I think. Everyone else had gone deeper down by then."</p><p>Cave explorers are, by nature, an odd group. You assume they are playing some sort of trick on you. </p><p>You ask: "Do you have any proof?"</p><p>He nods. He hands you his phone, and you see a series of pictures, all stitched together into a single large image. It depicts a cave wall peopled with recognizable human shapes. These scenes have been carved into the broad slab of granite with evident skill. You see a city depicted, with stalactites hanging over it instead of clouds. You see a king surrounded by bats. You see roads, carved out of rock, leading down, down, down, deeper into the subterranean world.</p><p>The final picture shows a man\'s gloved hand, holding a worn-down chisel. Its wooden handle has splintered away, leaving only the rusted iron body.</p><p>You can see that all of these images were photographed at close range, blown out by the bright illumination of a camera flash. Darkness creeps in at the edges of the frame.</p><p>When you camp next to the underground stream that night, you are especially alert to the many unknown and unexplainable sounds that frequently arise in underground spaces like this.',

          "After making an honest effort to be admitted into the Circuit de Monaco Grand Prix race, and being denied multiple times by the committee, you decide to take more drastic action.</p><p>On the night of the Grand Prix race, you break into the museum which houses the royal car collection. You borrow Prince Rainier III's 1963 Ferrari 250 GT. You leave a brief note explaining the situation, and the cruel actions of the committee that led you to this scurrilous end. If all goes according to plan, you will have the car back in place in the museum before anybody finds out. But, it seems right honest to leave a note, just in case.</p><p>As the race starts, you drop the hammer on this pristine Ferrari, crashing through a barrier to enter the track just before turn 1.</p><p>The current Prince, Albert II has kept his father's rare vehicle in great condition. Despite its advanced age, the mmighty V12 engine roars like a lion and leaps forward, approaching the back of the pack.</p><p>The cars in front of you have several advantages: they are 60 years newer, with more powerful engines, and much better suspensions, brakes, and tires. They are lighter, and more aerodynamic. Their top speed is much higher, and so is their cornering speed, and their acceleration, and their braking. And their cornering. Their drivers are professionals, and many of them have raced this course before.</p><p>No doubt about it, you've got your work cut out for you today. But the cherry red Ferrari has spent too long in a museum, and it feels like it wants to run. </p><p>So you let it. </p><p>On turn 2, you go flat out, and catch up to the last driver. He seems surprised to see an antique collectible vehicle driven by a tourist in his rear view mirror, and very surprised to see it gaining on him. You overtake him on the Massenet curve, and honk the horn as you pass. </p><p>By the time you approach Turn 6, the famous \"Fairmont Hairpin\", you're near the middle of the pack, with a bunch of very angry drivers jockeying for position behind you. </p><p>Fairmont is famously tight, and even the high-tech F1 cars have to slow to a crawl to get around it without slamming into the barricade. You decide to take a risk, and fly into the corner at a break-neck speed, flicking the back wheels out and drifting around the corner, passing several vehicles in the process. Looking in your side-view mirror, you see the rear bumper miss the walls of the barricade by no more than a centimeter. </p><p>You hold your position through a series of turns, then weave through some tricky chicanes, passing more vehicles. The crowds are cheering for you, so you roll down the window and wave at them as you pass by.</p><p>With the windows down, you can hear police sirens approaching, and you decide you need to make a move.</p><p>As you enter Turn 17, La Rascasse, you're right on the bumper of the lead vehicle. 17 is a 90-degree right, and you think you've got the nerves to take the lead on the inside. </p><p>You dive into the corner, trying to hold your highly aggressive line. Unfortunately, your aging vehicle is just not able to keep its grip, and you feel it beginning to slip. If you keep this up, there's a chance you can hold it, but an equal chance you'll spin, hit the wall, and possibly scratch the paint.</p><p>You have to choose, and quickly. The police sirens are getting closer.</p><p>You decide that getting first place isn't worth damaging someone else's property. Better get this car back where it belongs.</p><p>Instead of completing the turn, you straighten the wheel and head toward a slope in the course barrier. You use the barricade as a ramp, and launch yourself off the road, and sail over the crowd.</p><p>You land the car, and drive away, with the police unable to follow. You make one stop, at a gas station, to refuel the car and give it a quick wash and wax, before taking it back to the museum where Prince Rainier's collection is housed. </p><p>As you pull the car back into its spot, the police are waiting for you. You prepare yourself to be taken into custody. It was worth it to get to drive in the Circuit de Monaco, the most famous of all F1 races.</p><p>There is a man standing with the police. The man is middle-aged, dressed in a well-tailored suit, and he's smiling warmly. You'd know that face anywhere: it's Albert II, Crown Prince of Monaco!</p><p>\"Prince Albert,\" you say apologetically. \"I'm sorry I borrowed your car without asking, but you see, the committee——\"</p><p>He waves you off. \"I understand. Blast the committee! I'm just happy to see one of my father's favorite cars put through its paces again.\"</p><p>He turns to the police.</p><p>\"Officers, I see no reason to press charges. Were you watching the race today? In my view, the real crime would be for a beautiful machine like this to be locked away in a museum forever, never to experience its true purpose under the steady the hands of a born driver.\"</p><p>You thank the Prince, and ask if you can use the bathroom. He invites you to lunch, and you have a nice dish of fish, and then some kind of lemon thing.",

          'In 1452, The Virgin Mary appeared to two fishermen in the Bay of Kotor, on a tiny pile of rocks in the middle of the water. Naturally, they built a church there, and that church is called Our Lady of the Rocks.</p><p>The church sits on a platform of stone, atop an island of rocks. These rocks were filled in by the fishermen, but also by the local faithful, who drop small rocks into the lake in order to expand the size of the church, bit by bit.</p><p>Normally, the church isn\'t hard to see from nearby Perast, where you\'re staying, but looking out at the bay from your hotel room this morning, you couldn\'t see it at all.</p><p>At breakfast, the disappearing church is all anybody can talk about. Where did it go? There was an earthquake last night, one of the guests points out. Some of the guests nod, others admit they slept right through it. Always a sound sleeper, you were in the latter group: you didn\'t notice a thing.</p><p>"Maybe the church sank during the earthquake?"</p><p>At this, everyone at the breakfast table gets quiet. It\'s a sad thought, imagining that a 600 year old church could just slide into the sea one night, while you were sleeping. It survived through all the disasters and wars of the last half millenium, only to succumb to a measly little earthquake. Something isn\'t right, and you intend to investigate.</p><p>"Something isn\'t right," you say, slamming your fist down on the table, "and I intend to investigate!"</p><p>Two of the others (Peter and Agatha) agree to join you, so you all take a rowboat out to the island, vowing to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p>When you get to where the church used to be, you find only a flat area of piled stones, just below the surface of the water. Granted, it\'s about the size of the church, but it doesn\'t look like debris at all. If the church itself had collapsed after the earthquake, you\'d certainly expect to see a chaotic mess of masonry, roofing tiles, and the like, but this all looks like ordinary, irregularly-shaped stones.</p><p>"It\'s just the pile of rocks the church was built on," says Agatha, "I\'d expect the ruins of the church to be on top of it."</p><p>"It might all have been fallen away from the pile," Peter offers, uncertain.</p><p>"There\'s another possibility," you point out. "the church might have floated away."</p><p>You explain your theory: maybe the earthquake jostled the church just enough to break the connection between the platform the church was built on, and the pile of rocks that supported it.</p><p>"That\'s crazy, it would just sink, not float away. The church is made out of rocks, and rock is heavier than water."</p><p>Peter points to a nearby sunken rock, as though it were new information to anyone.</p><p>"Maybe not," you say. "Aircraft carriers are made out of steel, and steel is heavier than water too. If the platform was broad enough, and sturdy enough, it might just work."</p><p>"Look!"</p><p>Agatha is staring at the horizon. You turn to follow her gaze, and see a small building with a larger dome, and a smaller domed tower bobbing in the waves.</p><p>You row toward it, and find that your theory was correct: Our Lady of the Rocks is floating, "unmoored", right in the middle of the water. In fact, the stiff morning wind has caught it, and brought it halfway to the mouth of the Adriatic!</p><p>Bringing your boat alongside, you are greeted by the priest and caretaker, who wave to you. They explain how they slept through the earthquake as well, and upon waking in the morning, discovered themselves adrift, and unable to signal for help. They were beginning to be worried they might end up lost in the shipping lanes</p><p>Later, when the church has been returned to its former location, you row out to the island again to inspect it. The priest shows you how concrete footings have been added to the building platform to prevent it from separating again. He also tells you that he has purchased a flare gun, two life jackets, and a ship-to-shore radio, though he reassures you that they won\'t be necessary.</p><p>"You\'ll want one of these, too," you say, handing him a paddle.',

He intends to read certain verses from the Quran, which are known to banish evil spirits like this, while the other members of the team perform other rites to cleanse the school, and ward away any future incursions.</p><p>"You want me to just wait outside?

When the team enters, Jorge shakes your hand, and you nod at each other. He shuts the door behind them, and you lock it from the outside, then stand, silent, listening.</p><p>You hear chanting in Arabic. You hear hissing, and chittering laughter, and a sound like leaves blowing across concrete. More chanting in Arabic. You smell sulfur, and other foul things. There are loud banging noises, and furniture being scraped. You hear screams — human screams, you think — and then silence.</p><p>The silence persists for several moments. Then, there is someone at the door, rattling it desperately, and pounding on it with their fists. </p><p>"Let us out! Let us out! I know what I told you, but it\'s time to let us out!"</p><p>You hesitate, hand on the lock. This might be a trick.</p><p>"Recite those verses again," you say.

You recognize the words, they are the same ones Jorge spoke a few moments before. This might be Jorge. It\'s probably Jorge. But if it\'s not, then it\'s whatever has just killed Jorge and his team, and you\'re about to let it out.</p><p>When he finishes reciting, you hold your breath and unlock the door. It swings open immediately, to reveal three people. They are sweaty, and their clothes are torn, and they look very much the worse for wear. But, they are smiling weakly.</p><p>"That was a tough job," says Jorge. "A popobawa. The worst kind of Shetani. Very, uhh, violent. Potentially. But, we got rid of him for now."</p><p>He puts his hand on your shoulder. </p><p>"You did the right thing, locking the door. And not opening it until you were sure it was us. You\'ve got good instincts. You\'d make a good member of my team, if you ever wanted to join us." He is smiling warmly.</p><p>You all go out for a meal of </em>dobrada</em>, a dish of tripe and beans.

Throwing the bag over your shoulder, you begin to walk.</p><p>On a beach empty of footprints, you walk all through the night. The full moon hangs above you like a spotlight. You watch crabs skittering across the wet sand, and try to catch some. You succeed only in getting pinched by tiny crab claws, which sends you running away howling in pain.</p><p>The nezt day, with the sun beating down, and the heat climbing to over 100 degrees fahrenheit, you hide in the shade of a large boulder. You take small sips of the warm water through your cracked lips, rationing the water as best you can. Each drop is precious, and with every sip you watch your last liter dwindling down to nothing. </p><p>On the second night, as you are make your way along the coast, you see lights appraching in the distance. These are the headlights of two small quad bikes, driven by men with guns over their shoulders. On the back of the bikes are large, well-secured packages loaded with who-knows-what. Smugglers, taking a risky trip through this no man\'s land. </p><p>With a cracked, rasping voice, you beg them to take you with them. They glance at the packages they\'re carrying: "no room". Whatever they are carrying, it is more valuable than your life.</p><p>They don\'t rescue you, but in a gesture of almost miraculous humanity, they do toss you several bottles of water. They look at you with pity as one of the bottles disappears immediately down your parched thoat, then sputter on down the beach and out of earshot. </p><p></"Thank you!" you croak after them in a weak, ragged voice.</p><p>On the third day, when your water supply is exhausted again, you hit upon an idea. You decide to sacrifice two of your empty plastic bottles to rig up a contraption that catches the condensation of evaporating seawater. After a long, nervous afternoon of waiting in the hot sun, you manage to almost fill your two remaining bottles, and for the first time are able to drink your fill.</p><p>That night, you devise a method to catch crabs: instead of grabbing them with your fingers, you smash them with a long stick. You harvest a half dozen of the small crabs, and roast them over the fire. Despite the lack of seasoning, they taste delicious. </p><p>After eighteen more days of talking, you stagger into Swakopomund. You are surprised to hear German voices greeting you, but then you remember that Swakopomund is an isolated, former German colonial town, where many people still speak the old language. </p><p></"Guten tag!" you call you, waving.</p><p>The locals stare at you. You are filthy, covered in blood from various sources, draped in a hyena pelt, and holding a rusted scimitar and a bag of gems. </p><p>There simply isn\'t time to explain the pack of hyenas you fought, or ancient Barbary pirate ship you plundered, but to be sure, they were unique and fulfilling adventures that you\'ll never forget.',

I\'ll choose five, and you choose five. If I win more events than you, you have to increase the political freedom for ordinary people in North Korea."</p><p>"And what happens when I win more than you?" he asks.</p><p>"Then I\'ll publicly admit that North Korea is the best country in the world," you say.</p><p>You shake hands and begin the competition.</p><p>Supreme Leader Kim selects the first event: painting. He paints an amazing picture of some revolutionary Koreans fighting off imperialist American soldiers. It\'s vivid, expressive, yet technically flawless in its rendering. You paint a cat smiling next to a house, with a rainbow going over it (the rainbow has three colors).</p><p>"You won that one," you admit.</p><p>He takes the next two events too: sailing and film criticism. He learned to sail before he could walk, and is the son of the world\'s most respected expert on movies, the owner of 20,000 DVDs.</p><p>"The score is three to nothing," he says, with a serene smile.</p><p>You select half-court basketball for the next competition. He laughs.</p><p>"You sure you want to do that? I studied basketball under Dennis Rodman himself."</p><p>This is true: Kim and the former Chicago Bulls superstar have been close for years.</p><p>"I meant what I said. No doubt about it, Rodman was a relentless defender. He probably taught you how to rebound with the best of them. But that won\'t do any good against this."</p><p>At that, you pivot, fade back beyond the three point line, and drain a perfect shot as Kim, chasing you, gets crossed up and falls flat on his face. He rises up slowly, obviously frustrated with himself.</p><p>You claim victory in the basketball game, and select a baking competition for the next event. You make some Hwangnambbangg, the delightful, lightly sweetened pastry stuffed with red bean paste. As it melts in his mouth, Kim nods slowly, then begins to smile.</p><p>"It is among the most perfect things I, or anyone, have ever eaten. You win."</p><p>He brings out his own offering, a tray of ice cubes with sugar and red pepper flakes dumped on them. It doesn\'t look very appealing, and neither of you want to taste it. He admits that he has never cooked for himself before, but asks you to acknowledge that he is a natural chef, who, with even an hour of practice, would certainly become your superior.</p><p>That makes the score three to two, with half the competition over.</p><p>For your next event, you choose a sprinting competition. Leader Kim tips the scales at over three hundred pounds, and looks like he doesn\'t get a lot of exercise. You line up next to him in the blocks, and when the starter pistol fires, you take an early lead.</p><p>Just as you\'re about to cross the finish line, you see a dark blur run past you. He looks like a little sausage wearing a black suit, but Kim Jong-un can apparently move when he needs to. He beats you by a full step, and doesn\'t seem to be out of breath.</p><p>He laughs at you as you try to catch your breath.</p><p>"Four to two."</p><p>He chooses novel writing as the next competition, and easily bests you again. He writes a compelling political allegory about two lovers, swept up in the Korean war, who become freedom fighters and choose to sacrifice their lives to repel an imperialist commando unit at Incheon. It takes you longer to read the novel than it took him to write it, and by the time you have closed the last page he has written a sequel. Both sell a million copies in Pyongyang, and are dramatized as a TV mini-series that is mandatory viewing for all loyal citizens.</p><p>"Five to two. One more win, and complete victory over the west is at hand," he says.</p><p>He chooses golf for the next event. Kim\'s father, Kim Jong-il, was an excellent golfer, getting 38 under par, with 11 holes in one during his first game ever.</p><p>The match is difficult, but you just barely squeak out a victory, with a score of 25 under par. The younger Kim is not happy with his performance, having only gotten six holes in one. He throws half of his golf clubs in a pond, and bends the rest of them around a telephone pole.</p><p>Five to three, and the final two events are yours to choose.</p><p>You challenge your opponent to a game of chess. He immediately pulls out to a healthy lead, taking a knight and both bishops against your knight. You start playing defensively, but find his aggressive attacks both ingenious and merciless. He beats you back into a tactically disadvantaged position, then closes in for the kill.</p><p>That\'s when you notice the earpiece he\'s wearing. "What\'s that?" you say, pointing at it.</p><p>"This? It\'s nothing, nothing."</p><p>You walk across the room to a nearby closet, fling it open, and discover a chess grandmaster hiding inside it. Not noticing you, he continues is whispering chess moves into a microphone.</p><p>Caught in the act, Kim has no choice but to forfeit the event to you.</p><p>That makes the score five to four, with only one event left. This is it: you can\'t win, but there may be a way to avoid losing.</p><p>"For the final event, I choose... nuclear disarmament!"</p><p>Kim winces, then scowls at you. It is well known that North Korea has been stockpiling nuclear weapons for years, using the threat of global thermonclear warfare in a long-running game of diplomatic brinksmanship against its political adversaries. Much of the North Korean foreign policy playbook centers around threatening to detonate atomic bombs, so the last thing the Supreme Leader want to do is compete to see how many nukes he can disarm.</p><p>You\'ve got him over a barrel. In order to win, he\'ll have to give up his greatest weapon.</p><p>He sighs, seeing the difficulty of his situation.</p><p>"I\'m afraid I must decline to compete. That leaves our final score at five wins for you, and five for me."</p><p>"A tie!" you say, nodding vigorously. "I can live with that."</p><p>You extend your hand. He takes it, and gives you a sweaty handshake and a stare that appears just a little bit ominous.</p><p>But you are satisfied. This decathlon was an epic competition, with high stakes.</p><p>For the sake of the millions of oppressed people suffering under his corrupt and repressive regime, you\'d have much preferred to win outright. But, you did your best, and have nothing to be ashamed of. Next time!</p><p>That night, North Korean agents kidnap you from your hotel and keep you in a dark cell for days, until U.N. ambassadors successfully negotiate for your release by defeating North Korea\'s leader at a game of croquet.',

It's one thing to watch legendary athletes like Robert Johansson gracefully fly 144 meters through the air after launching themselves from Holmenkollbakken, but it's another thing to imagine yourself plunging down this steep slope and trying to land without breaking your neck.</p><p>\"What am I doing here?\" you ask yourself. \"I've never even been ski jumping before!\"</p><p>You begin to remove your 'skis', ready to admit that you don't have what it takes. There's plenty more to see and do in Norway.</p><p>Just then, you see a group of school children in the distance, at the bottom of the slope. They're staring up at you, cheering, urging you on. You can't let them down. You won't let them down.</p><p>Then you are flying down the slope. Your legs shake as the skis rattle, picking up speed. The wind is whipping through your hair.</p><p>The conditions aren't perfect — it's summer — but then again neither is your technique. Instead of standard alpine skis, you have two large water skis, like the kind you'd wear on a lake, strapped to your feet. You are wearing street clothes: jeans, and a t-shirt, and a hat that immediately blew off as soon as you started sliding down this precipitous, dangerous ramp.</p><p>There's a moment of panic when you reach the end of the ramp, but as you soar through the air, it turns to exhilaration. You can see so far from up here! There is a feeling of freedom, too. Is this what it's like to be a bird?</p><p>When you hit the ground, which is just grass and dirt, your skies fly off, and you roll head over heels down the mountain, coming to rest on a car. The school children help you to your feet.</p><p>Together, you find the spot where you landed, and measure it: 145 meters, a new record!</p><p>\"But,\" says the childrens' elementary school teacher, while calling for an ambulance, \"I'm afraid it doesn't count unless you land the jump. Because you fell, you see, it's not official.\"</p><p>You laugh it off.</p><p>\"Well, I guess Robert Johannson's record is secure... for now!\"</p>",

The look of grim determination on your face stifles any further argument from the pilot, who winces at the bruise he can feel forming, and turns back to the controls without further comment.</p><p>You are hunkered inside the <em>Gravity IV</em>, a deep diving submersible, currently 2000 meters below the surface of the Pacific. Below you is another four kilometers of water, and then the ocean floor. Somewhere down there in all that darkness is your yellow flashlight, which fell overboard while you were taking a selfie on deck. In your dreams, you watch it tumbling from your hands, helpless to catch it. It slides below the surface of the water, greening for an instant through the lens of the water, and then dimming as it sinks out of sight.</p><p> And now you are following its path down into the Galathea Deep, 6000 meters down. The submersible you\'re in is rated for that depth, but the pilot lost his nerve when the captain cracked his head on the vessel\'s low ceiling, and fell unconscious. He pleaded to return to the surface, but you reminded him of the contract he\'d signed.</p><p>Finally, you had to result to force to keep him at his station.</p><p>"The captain will be fine," you assured him then, rubbing your stinging knuckles.</p><p>You repeat the same words now. The captain is asleep, his breathing regular. He is strapped into his chair to keep him upright, since there\'s no place to lay him down in the tiny capsule.</p><p> Gravity descends through the bathylpelagic zone, also called the midnight zone because of its sheer, almost uninterrupted blackness. Occasionally, you catch glimpses of bioluminescent through the porthole, like stars hanging in the sky at night. This is the bottom of the sea, past which there is only the abyss.</p><p>  At 5000 meters, you are in the middle of a dead zone in which there is no oxygen to support plant or animal life, and the water hovers just above freezing. The only animals here are invertebrates and certain unusually hardy fish, gluttons for punishment, who can wishstand the 11,000 pounds per square inch of pressure from the overhanging column of water.</p><p>You watch as the alien shape of a jellyfish slides past the window. You see anglerfish, dangling their glowing lures in front of them.</p><p>Suddenly, you see a long shadow cross your field of vision.</p><p>A shadow? Not possible. There\'s no light down here to cast one!</p><p>Massive, tentacles have wrapped themselves around your craft, obscuring the vehicle\'s searchlights as they pass in front of them. The submersible creaks and groans as the tentacles constrict it tightly, squeezing with what must be incredible strength. Through the tiny window, you can see that each tentacle is covered with hundreds of suckers.</p><p> A giant squid!</p><p>"It\'s pulling us down!" the pilot screams, wrenching the controls fruitlessly, as though he could use them to steer his way out of a death grip.</p><p> The craft begins to shake violently as the squid spirals downward into the darkness, rolling as it falls like a bullet twisting in the air. You are thrown against the walls, again and again, and feel something in your rib cage crack. The pilot, buckled into his chair, merely emits a continuous scream of terror.</p><p>  "Orange... switch..." you hear a voice say. It is the captain, awake, eyes half open.</p><p>  The panicked pilot doesn\'t seem to have heard the captain, or noticed him, but you manage to crawl across the cabin floor and reach your hand out to just barely touch the smooth orange plastic switch in the middle of the console: "shock 2" the label reads. You flip it.</p><p>  A scream reverberates through the capsule, and the squid immediately releases the submersible. It flees upward and away, trailing a cloud of ink darker than the dark water itself.</p><p>  The craft comes to rest on the floor of the ocean. Six thousand meters below sea level is the mouth of hell: Literally, because this area is named after Hades himself. The pressure here is enormous, and life only exists because of the warm, nutrient-rich deep sea vents that spew red-hot toxic gas from the bowels of the earth. This Hadal Zone is found only in nightmares and deep sea trenches, and it was first discovered by a previous expedition to this very part of the ocean.</p><p>When the captain comes around, he explains how giant squid can be a big problem down here, and that deep divers have started adding defenses against them, like the electric field you activated when you threw that switch.</p><p>"Not enough to kill the beast, but enough to make it think twice."</p><p>  "I thought giant squid were extremely rare," you say.</p><p>  "I wish that were true." He sighs, shaking his head. "No. Ignore what you see on the National Geographic. They\'re a menace at this depth."</p><p> When the inky water has dispersed, you can easily spot your yellow flashlight not far from where you landed. The titanium housing looks like it\'s held up well to the pressure; even the glass looks to be intact.</p><p>The pilot skillfully retrieves it with the remote-manipulation arms, and you feel a sense of relief to have it back, safe and sound.',

At just over 2500 meters, it is the tallest peak on the list, so it\'s nice to get it out of the way early. </p><p>Next you hit Wielka Sowa, a much shorter peak in the Owl Mountains.

Instead of defining a "day" as a single 24 hour period, you will think of it as the time between waking and sleeping, however long that is. As long as you can stay awake, you tell yourself, <em>my</em> day has not ended. </p><p>You vow to climb the remaining 25 peaks without sleeping.</p><p>The next 6 peaks go by easily. You yawn a bit while summiting the jewel of the Bystrzyckie Mountains, Jogodna, but it only makes you quicken your pace to get the blood flowing. </p><p>Morning comes as you are hiking up Ślęża, a relatively short (700 meter) mountain with a lot of history. The slopes of this granite hill are covered in ruins, and you stop to admire a statue of a bear, carved by ancient Celts untold centuries ago. The bear waves at you and tells you not to give up, and you wave back. </p><p>That afternoon, after crossing a few more mountains off your list, you look around and wonder where you are. You are still walking up a pleasant, grassy slope, but you don\'t remember which mountain you\'re on. You seem to have zoned out for a while. You stop some other hikers and ask them the name of the place, and they tell you you\'re almost to the top of Tarnica, a 1300-meter wonder in the Bieszczady Mountains. </p><p>"Are you all right?" they ask, and also "when is the last time you slept?"</p><p>You check your watch. </p><p>"About 38 hours ago, but technically—"</p><p>You start to tell them about the mission you\'ve set for yourself, but their faces disappear. Soon you realize you\'ve been talking to some bushes growing on the side of the trail. For no clear reason, you apologize for wasting their time, and then continue along the path, shaking your head to try to clear it.</p><p>At midnight, you are climbing the second tallest massif in the Crown, Babia Góra. Ahead of you, you see a bonfire burning, and a group of women cackling and dancing around it. Colorful wisps of smoke rise up from the fire, making strange shapes in the air that move with what seems like a kind of malevolent intelligence. This must be the witches\' sabbath, something you\'ve heard about in folk tales associated with this region. </p><p>You pinch yourself, trying to figure out whether it is a hallucination or not. No matter how many times you try to blink away the vision, it is still there when you open your eyes. At last you decide to sneak past it.</p><p>The next day, your feet are almost too heavy to lift as you drag yourself up Łysica, the 28th and final mountain on the list.

In fact, you\'ve reached the highest possible point in the  entire Świętokrzyskie range. Looking back down from where you came, you see the trail you\'ve just followed, switchbacking its way down the mountain, back to the nearby village of Święta Katarzyna. In the distance, you see farms, forests, and rivers. Beyond them, dim and hazy, the peaks of other mountains already climbed.</p><p>Beside you stands an older woman, evidently the source of the voice. She tells you her name, and says that she\'s been following you for the last few peaks, after you told her what you were doing. She was worried about your health. </p><p>"I kept telling you this was a terrible idea, but you wouldn\'t give up, so I thought I\'d better help you finish."</p><p>"Thank you. But, I have to ask: are you real, or just another hallucination?"</p><p>She slaps you across the face. It feels real, but it\'s hard to know for sure anymore. Tears well up in your eyes, both because of her generousity, and because you just realized your journey is actually over. You lay down beside a log and go to sleep, waking in the darkness of the next day to find yourself alone.</p><p>',

When the water smashes the back wall of the cliff, it roils and crashes, throwing spray and foam into the air, and making a terrific roar. All of this is can be seen from above, and it is an impressive sight indeed.</p><p> After a lunch of caldeirada and dark bread, you take an afternoon nap in your hotel room. Awakening at sunset, you make your way out to the seaside after dark. The tourists are gone now, and you\'ve got the place to yourself.  </p><p>  You stand at the guardrail above the chasm, watching the turbulent water brawling with the cliffs. The moon is high and full, and clear enough to read the warning signs telling you not to climb over the rail, because it could be dangerous. </p><p> "More than dangerous. It is entirely fatal, I assure you."</p><p>  Looking up, you see an old man standing beside you. He is bald, a little bit with, with a severe mouth, and a keen, perceptive gaze. The moonlight shines through him, giving him a slight translucency that lets you know he is probably a ghost.</p><p> "You read my mind!" you say. </p><p> The ghost introduces himself as Aleister Crowley. He tells you that he once faked his death by pretending to leap from this very spot. You ask him why he did that.</p><p> "Well, I was a fraud. I pretended to do a lot of things. That was pretty much my whole deal."</p><p> "What were some other things you did?"</p><p>  "Well, I pretended to summon a demon. I pretended to talk to the Roman gods Mercury and Jupiter. I started my own fake religion based around having sex with me. I wrote some books that were mostly garbage. Stuff like that." He shrugs.</p><p> "Are you now doomed to talk the earth to atone for your sins in life?"</p><p>  Crowley shakes his head.</p><p> "You\'d think so, but no, I managed to avoid that. I just like coming back here to watch the waves. It\'s a nice spot, isn\'t it?" </p><p>  In silent agreement, you both stop chatting and turn back to the ocean beneath you. The ceaseless churning of the waves is ancient, primal, powerful. The rhythm has a hypnotic effect, and you lose track of time. </p><p> When you look up again, the ghost of Aleister Crowley has vanished. The moonlight hits the empty pavement where he stood only moments before. He is gone, though perhaps his troubled spirit is finally at rest.</p><p>  But then on the way back to the car, you see him coming out of the restroom, and heading back to the cliff again.',

Bad publicity could really hurt the island."</p><p>You tell them that you\'ll do your best, and exactly twenty minutes later, you\'re riding in a patrol car out to where the ship is docked. With you is the chief detective of the Basseterre police force, a weary veteran, only six months from retirement.</p><p>"The ship is almost empty, except for the crew," he reassures you, "but they\'ll be back tonight, so you need to work quickly if we\'re going to keep this under wraps."</p><p>You tell him: "This will be quick.

Negotiate if you can, pay up if you can\'t. They\'ve got you outpositioned. They\'re in there, fortified, just waiting for you try something. Don\'t be stupid."</p><p>You shake your head in grim appreciation of the situation.</p><p>"And another thing: you need to accept that this is going to get into the press, if it hasn\'t already. That\'s why you need to do this right now. If you think twelve hostages is bad for tourism, imagine how twelve dead hostages will play."</p><p>The detective sets his lips in a frown. You can almost see his teeth grinding. At last, he nods slowly.</p><p>"Okay," he sighs. "You win. We\'ll pay the bastards."<p><p>He he turns to you, trying to keep the note of pleading from his voice.</p><p>"We don\'t have a lot of money. Will... will you at least help us negotiate?"</p><p>You insist that you\'re not a negotiator, just a tourist \'passing through\'. He persists, and eventually, as you always knew you would, you agree to make an attempt. Someone has to help get those innocent people out of there.</p><p>Soon, you are standing in the ship\'s control room, talking to the head terrorist on a walkie-talkie.</p><p>In a thick, generically European accent, he stakes out an aggressive opening position: "two hundred million dollars in non-sequential, unmarked U.S. dollars, and a helicopter, fully fueled. That is my only offer, and any response from you other than \'yes, sir,\' will result in the death of half the hostages. Immediately. Do I make myself clear?"</p><p>Over the course of the next four minutes, you manage to secure the release of the hostages, and talk down the ransom demand to about $1600 each in Amazon gift certificates, contingent upon every member of the terrorist cell writing a letter of apology and turning themselves in to the chief detective of the Basseterre police department.</p><p>As the last of the criminals is led away in handcuffs, the buses full of tourists begin to arrive at the dock. The tourists, laughing, slightly drunk, and completely unaware, begin piling out of the vehicles and making their way back onto the ship.</p><p>The detective shakes your hand.</p><p>"Looks like you\'re a pretty good negotiator after all," he says, "I\'m glad I met you in that hotel lobby.

          "Pico Cão Grande is a needle-like volcanic plug which rises like an enormous witch's hat out of the jungles of São Tomé and Príncipe, to a height of 2175 feet above sea level.</p><p> While climbing it, you discover that the steep, moss-slick sides of the peak are literally crawling with snakes. Seems like everywhere you want to put your hands or feet has a snake there already. They hiss angry warnings at you, but stand their ground.</p><p> Equally stubborn, you continue to climb, not wanting to give up on your dream of reaching the top. You sustain multiple bites from a several different species, all venemous. Fortunately, you have been bitten by so many snakes on your trip already that you've developed a fairly strong immunity to most types of snake venom, and are able to proceed, though not without significant discomfort.</p><p> Pico Cão Grande is Portuguese for \"Great Dog Peak\". As you stand at the summit and look out over the jungle, your eyes almost completely swollen shut from the snake bites on your forehead, you wonder where the name comes from. Is it because the remarkably tall, sharply-pointed mountain looks like a dog's tooth? Or, might one of the original discoverers have had a great dog he was commemorating by naming a landmark after it?</p><p> Head aching, and heart racing, you sit down to catch your breath, and stop the world from spinning. </p><p>  The next thing you know, you're waking up in the middle of the night. Initially unsure about where you are, you eventually realize that, in a venom-induced break from reality, you must have climbed a few hundred feet down the almost vertical eastern flank of the mountain. You are now perched on a narrow shelf of rock about eight inches wide, with approximately nine hundred feet of empty space underneath you. The lights of Vila Clotilde wink in the distance, and the larger town of São João dos Angolares can be seen as a glow on the horizon.</p><p>  After a minute or two, you notice that several snakes have their jaws clamped onto you. By this point, you've been bitten so often, you can barely notice them! Your immunity is very nearly complete, and though you're still feeling feverish and weak, you laugh scornfully at their ongoing attempts to kill you. </p><p> \"On your way, little ones,\" you say, pulling the snakes off your legs and neck, and sending them slinking back into the innumerable cracks and crevices where they make their nests. </p><p> Nonetheless, you do feel tired, and your fingers and toes are still swollen. Keeping that in mind, and allowing some added caution due to the darkness, you decide not to do any more climbing tonight. Lying on your side, you are able to catch a few hours of precarious sleep on the narrow shelf.</p><p>  By the next morning, as the humid mist floats up from the jungle floor, you feel fine. Though eager to get back the rest of your vacation, you are reluctant to start, since it means giving up this incredible view of the island. Ultimately, the rumbling of your hungry belly entices you to get moving, and you are able to resume your descent without further problems. </p><p>  Indeed, the way down is easier than the way up, because you don't need to pay any attention to the snakes, except to admire the beauty of their colorful, scaly skin.

The old building exudes a powerful feeling of shadowy, gothic horror — maybe that\'s why it has been the setting of so many vampire movies over the years. </p><p>You hear about a new vampire movie filming on location at the castle, and decide to join the cast. After going through multiple rounds of auditions and callbacks, you finally land the part of a minor vampire, a servant of the main vampire (no spoilers, but it\'s Count Dracula). Your big scene comes near the middle of the picture, when you try to sneak up on the hero and suck his blood while he\'s chopping vegetables for a stew. </p><p>You creep up behind him, wearing a big black vampire cape. It\'s somewhat distracting, because instead of being in a regular room, you\'re on a set, and there are dozens of crew members standing around holding cameras, microphones, lights, and so on. The director sits close by, in a tall, specially designed chair that folds up, so that it can be moved from location to location. The chair has her name on it the back.</p><p>"Cut!" the director yells. She seems frustrated, but is trying to remain polite.</p><p>"Vampire Minion, what\'s going on? Your sightlines were all over the place."</p><p>"I was looking at the cameras, lighting rigs, and boom microphones," you admit. A film set is a fascinating place to be, and you don\'t want to miss anything.</p><p>"Just look at Benedict," says the director. "Look at him like you want to bite his neck, because that\'s what your character wants."</p><p>She\'s talking about Benedict Cumberbatch, the star of the picture. He is playing the hero, a famous vampire hunteer who is visiting the village.</p><p>On the second take, you focus on not being distracted by the film crew. You sneak across the room, toward Benedict Cumberbatch, who is facing away from you, busily chopping vegetables. You have a sinister look on your face, like: "I\'m about to suck your blood, and you don\'t even know it."</p><p>As you approach him, the camera operator pulls focus away from you, toward a closeup of Cumberbatch\'s hands. He is holding a kitchen knife in one hand, and a carrot in the other. As everybody knows, a sharp knife is no good against a vampire: only a stake through the heart can kill them.</p><p>In an insert shot, we see the hero realize there is someone behind him, then quickly cut the end of the carrot into a sharp point. Then, the camera cuts to an action shot of Cumberbatch whipping around, and driving the sharpened carrot straight into your heart. That part was done by two stunt performers, a week before you arrived on set. The shot of your body turning to stone and shattering into a million pieces of dust was added later, by a digital effects studio in Croatia.  </p><p>After the scene is completed, you are released from set for the day, and go on a tour of the castle. You learn that large parts of the castle had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1800. You also learn that Orava was used as a model for a castle in something called The Witcher.</p><p>Thinking it might help inform his performance, you tell this to the star when you see him walking to his car after shooting has completed. </p><p>"Not just vampires, but witches too, huh? Pretty wild stuff! Right?"</p><p>When the movie comes out the next year, you notice that the stew-making scene was removed entirely. In the theatrical cut of the movie, you are only visible in the background of a single shot. You are staring at something off camera, most likely a teamster.',

          'What do you know about the USS <em>Aaron Ward</em>?"</p><p>The man\'s voice on the phone is low and gruff. A cigar smoker\'s voice, most likely. Older, you\'d say late middle age. Educated and commanding. You\'d say this is a man used to asking questions.</p><p>"The <em>Aaron Ward</em> was a U.S. Navy destroyer in WWII. It sank just off the tip of Florida Island, in the Solomons. Japanese dive bombers. February 6, 1943."</p><p>"Very good. You know your history. But do you know about the treasure?"</p><p>Four days later, you are diving through the murky water of Iron Bottom Sound, graveyard for dozens of war ships and planes from the battle for nearby Guadalcanal. </p><p>You check your air tanks, and find them almost full. You are diving alone, to minimize the number of people who know why you\'re here. The old man warned you you might be followed, but checked over your shoulder a hundred times, and the coast was clear. Still, you can\'t shake the feeling of being watched.</p><p> </p><p>Moments later, the large, twisted bulk of the <em>Aaron Ward</em> emerges from the dark water, and you swim inside through a breach in the hull. </p><p>"My father served on the <em>Ortolan</em>, a minesweeper that helped rescue surivors on the <em>Ward</em>. One of the sailors he couldn\'t save, a midshipman from Illinois, told him about the treasure as he lay dying.</p><p>"As water poured into the compartment, the man told him about a certain solid gold crucifix, looted by the Japanese from a Catholic mission on one of the islands, and currently housed on board the sinking ship."</p><p>"How did the crucifix get onto the <em>Aaron Ward</em>?"</p><p>"It was... well, let\'s say it was... re-appropriated. The Japanese officer who stole it no longer had need of it."</p><p>"The Catholic mission, the Japanese officer, and then the sailor who took it. Sounds like this crucifix is bad luck for whoever has it."</p><p>"I don\'t believe in luck. I believe in the power of money, and that crucifix is worth a lot of it."</p><p>You ask why the man\'s father didn\'t take the crucifix with him eighty years ago. He laughs, and tells you there is a very good reason for that.</p><p>The light from your cutting torch illuminates the rear section of the ship, casting long, sharp shadows onto the muddy, algae-covered floor. The pressurized cutting medium glows blue-bright, a high-ratio mix of oxygen and acetyene gas burning through steel at over 6000 degrees.</p><p>You had to get a permit to buy this equipment, and take a special course. Most of the other students in the underwater welding course were oil rig or pipeline workers. When asked to introduce yourself to the class, and list a fun fact about yourself, you said "I\'m a treasure hunter, and my favorite fruit is bananas."</p><p>Once you\'ve cut all the way through the hinges of the bulkhead door, you are able to pry it open. Eighty years ago, the compartment behind it had filled with water, making it impossible to enter. That water doesn\'t make any difference to you now, but the years of corrosion had thoroughly stuck the door shut.</p><p>The crucifix is right where the man said it would be, hidden in a crate marked \'crackers\'. The wooden box has mostly rotted away, but you can see a glimmer of bright metal inside.</p><p>The crucifix is large, almost a foot long, and very heavy. The gold, and the jewels that decorate it, glint in the light of your headlamp. You feel the weight of it in your hands; not only the weight of the metal, but of the history behind it.</p><p>Movement reflected in the smooth surface. Turning around, you see a knife arcing through the water, in a long swipe that would have cut your air hose. Another diver has followed you into the wreck!</p><p>On pure reflex, you bring the crucifix up to block the attack. The silver of the steel cuts into the soft gold, leaving a deep gouge. </p><p>You fight the attacker across the deck. You manage to crack his breathing mask, forcing him to push away from you and swim to the surface. You use the distraction to escape the wreck, and return to your boat. When you break the surface, your mysterious attacker is gone.</p><p>"A dangerous job, but worth the risk," says the man. "You did well."</p><p>You\'re meeting him in person for the first time, on his yacht off the coast of Honiara.</p><p>"Here is your payment," he says, handing you a briefcase. You hand him the crucifix, wrapped in cloth.</p><p>"I\'d like to know who tried to kill me," you say.</p><p>"How would I know? You must have let something slip. Did you tell anyone you were hunting for treasure?"</p><p>His eyes light up as he unwraps the crucifix. You wonder whether the story about his father and the sailor was true. </p><p>"May it bring you good luck," you say.</p><p>Later, in your hotel room, you open the briefcase. It is full of bananas. Nothing but bananas. When you try to track down the man and his yacht, they are gone.',

They're called the Dead Cities, and one of the most impressive is the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites. </p><p>You arrive at the site in the morning, when the air is still cool, and unload your truck full lumber, with a few befuddled tourists looking on.</p><p>Saint Simeon the Stylite was an ascetic hermit who lived in the 5th century. He wandered in the wilderness, contemplating the meaning of the spiritual world, and generally eschewing the ecumenical one. He became so famous for his holiness that people flocked to him, and, in his mind, this defeated the purpose of being a hermit in the first place.</p><p>So, like you're doing today, he built a pillar and climbed up to a small platform on top of it, whereon he could consider the mysteries of the world in peace and quiet. </p><p>His first platform was three meters tall, but evidently that wasn't enough. Crowds continued to throng beneath him, asking him to perform miracles, and teach them the secrets of life, and so on. Multiple emperors even sought his advice, when all he really wanted was some time to think. </p><p>Eventually, Simeon decided to build a second platform, this one 18 meters high. That's a column 60 feet in the air, atop which St. Simeon spent all his days and nights, until his death.</p><p>You complete your own 18-meter pillar by noon, and carefully climb up to the top to eat your lunch. You brought a pita sandwich and some dates, and a can of soda.</p><p>Beneath you, more than a dozen tourists have gathered to take pictures of the hastily-built wooden structure. You dangle your legs over the edge of the platform, and look out at the great sweep of the arid hills around you. </p><p>As you chew your sandwich, you think about the nature of good and evil, and let your mind follow certain paths you'd never considered going down before. It feels, in a way, like being so thoroughly separated from the petty concerns of the world below you has allowed you to operate on a higher plane. Right around the time you swallow your last bite of sandwich, you achieve enlightenment, which elicits a slight belch.</p><p>When Saint Simeon died, the empire commissioned a massive and elaborate church be built on the site. A huge dome was erected around his pillar, like it was a holy object. Though the site was abandoned centuries later, pilgrims continued to visit the church, and chip away fragments of the pillar as keepsakes. Slowly, Simeon's pillar was worn down to a nub and scattered to hundreds of reliquaries and private collections all over the world. </p><p>In the early afternoon, police from Aleppo arrive and force you down off your pillar. You watch from the ground as the wooden pillar is cut down by a police chainsaw (it's a a chainsaw with the logo of the Aleppo police on it: what would you call it?) The debris is loaded into a dumptruck, and taken to the dump.</p><p>The subject of arrest and jail time is broached. Using your newly-acquired enlightened wisdom, you impress the chief of police enough that he lets you off with a fine, and a stern warning. Later that evening, the enlightenment wears off.",

Wouldn't there be throngs of people crowding the Vatican, not for the chance to bask in the holy spaces, but to catch even a fleeting glimpse of what is laid out before you right now — human, worldly, even profane — in this hidden chamber?</p><p>Well, one thing is for sure: it's a one of a kind experience, because you were told the door you entered through will never open for you again, and the room itself moves from year to year.</p><p>Standing in front of these treasures, you can almost hear your time here ticking down, second by second. You realize that in your brief stay here, you'll never get a chance to see even a fraction of the entire collection. The thought terrifies you. In preparation for that moment of eternal separation, you concentrate, trying to lock each piece in your memory. Hammering golden nails into your brain.</p><p>Will it work? You close your eyes, and to your horror, the image immediately fades, its awesome majesty too great to be imprisoned in finite space.</p><p>You feel a gentle, but irresistible pull, hands at your elbow, and are led out of the room forever.",

          "You've always wanted to see Angel Falls, the tallest waterfall in the world, and you've finally made it here!</p><p>The towering plunge of water is even more beautiful than you imagined. You walk around the base of the falls, taking it in from every angle. </p><p>Suddenly, you hear a voice behind you. \"It's a long way down.\" </p><p>You turn to see a man about your age, with dark hair and skin tanned by the sun. He's wearing shorts and a tank top, and he has a camera slung around his neck. He smiles at you. </p><p>\"I'll say. Do you think anyone has ever jumped from the top?\"</p><p>He nods. \"I've done it myself, it's quite an experience.\" </p><p>\"Do you think I could make it down?\" you ask doubtfully. </p><p>\"Of course,\" he says easily. \"I'll go with you if you want. Really no trouble at all.\"</p><p>You're not sure what to expect as you follow the man along the path to the top of the falls. He seems friendly enough, but you don't know him. </p><p>As you get closer, you can see the crest of the falls more clearly. The river isn't wide, and it looks like you can wade out to the edge, but it's a very long way down. Without ceremony, the man starts to walk out into an eddy upstream from the falls, and you hesitate for a moment before following him. </p><p>\"Coming?\" he says, looking back.</p><p>It's not as easy as he made it look, but eventually you make it to the edge of the falls. You have to hold on to a boulder to keep from being swept over. The water is cold and refreshing after the heat of the hike up here, and the thunder of the crashing water is almost deafening. </p><p>The man waits patiently as you enjoy the view. Angel Falls consists of two separate drops, the first one being the longest at just over 800 meters. It plunges straight down, past some rocky outcroppings. It looks like a difficult jump.</p><p>\"How deep is that pool at the bottom?\" you ask. It doesn't look deep enough, in your opinion. </p><p>When you look over to where he was standing in the river, you don't see the man on the bank. You call after him, but there is no answer. You look down, over the edge of the falls, half expecting to see him there, but no.</p><p>After a while, you decide against jumping. While it would be exciting, it doesn't seem safe. You start to question the man's motivations for luring you up here.</p><p>The climb down to the bottom of the falls is nerve-wracking. Why is climbing down sometimes harder than going up? Your arms and legs are shaking by the time you make it back to solid ground. </p><p>Looking at the base of the first drop, you confirm that it is little more than a shallow puddle, with hardly enough water to cover your shoes. It is filled with large stones and gravel, and (though it is hard to judge these things) if you landed on this after a fall of over 2600 feet straight down, you'd almost certainly break something — if not worse. </p><p>You look around for the man who tried to convince you to jump, but you can't find him anywhere.",

          'You board the gondola which will take you to the top of Vietnam\'s highest peak, the 10,312 ft Fansipan. The trip will take twenty minutes, and send you 1400 meters into the air in a small car suspended from three metal cables.</p><p>Below you, a carpet of coniferous trees gently slides past, mingled with wisps of the cloud layer you are passing through on your journey skyward. What a beautiful mountain, and what a calm voyage.</p><p>Suddenly, in the middle of the trip, the gondola suddenly lurches to a halt, and doesn\'t start again. Everything is unusually quiet.</p><p>Other passengers in the car are beginning to panic. </p><p>"Something\'s wrong," a man in a white hat says. </p><p>"Stop rocking the car, you\'ll make us fall," an older woman tells her companion, with an edge of terror creeping into her voice. </p><p>"Everybody just keep calm," urges a man in a dark suit, in a reassuring voice. For the time being, it seems to work, and the 8 passengers of the gondola sit together in silence, waiting for something to change. </p><p>Thirty minutes later, the car still isn\'t moving, and the passengers are getting visibly anxious. People keep checking their phones, trying to find something on Twitter which will explain the fear they\'re feeling, but there are no relevant hashtags for this situation.</p><p>"What the heck is going on?" someone asks.</p><p>And after two hours of hanging suspended in place, tempers are getting truly frayed. The confined space of the gondola was no problem when it seemed a very temporary state of affairs, but it has come to feel claustrophobic now that you\'re stuck here. The man in the white hat begins pacing back and forth in the narrow aisle between seats.</p><p>"Stop rocking the car!" shouts the older woman.</p><p>"Just shut up!"</p><p>"You can\'t talk to her like that!" says the woman\'s companion, standing up.</p><p>With a startling speed, the gondola goes from a state of anxious stillness to a storm of violent activity. A fight breaks out between the older woman\'s companion, and the man in the hat. Other passengers try to hold them back, and the commotion causes the gondola to begin rocking wildly on its cables.</p><p>You lose your balance, and are slammed against the side of the cabin, along with several others. </p><p>At the same time, the deafening sound of a gun shot explodes in the tiny space. </p><p>People begin screaming, and you feel a cold wind blowing against your face.</p><p>You look around and see that the man in the white hat has drawn a pistol, and fired it. He is holding it out now, trying to take aim at the older man as the car sways back and forth. </p><p>Acting on instinct, you dive across the cabin, tackling the man, and knocking the gun from his hands with a well-placed karate chop. </p><p>Instantly, the man in the blue suit picks up the fallen weapon, and points it at its owner. </p><p>"Don\'t me," he says, "you\'re under arrest for armed robbery, and attempted murder!"</p><p>Later, at the top of the gondola terminal, the man in the blue suit introduces himself as an interpol agent. He thanks you for your quick thinking in tackling the assailant before he could take another shot.</p><p>"It was close," you say, staring at the bullet hole in the window of the gondola. "It\'s a good thing the gondola was rocking, or his first shot wouldn\'t have missed."</p><p>The policeman nods. He explains that he knew one of the people on the gondola was the suspect he\'d been following all the way from Hanoi, but didn\'t know which one. </p><p>"Otherwise, I would have taken him before the ride ever started."</p><p>"But since you didn\'t know, you had them stop the gondola in the middle of the trip, until you figured out who it was!" </p><p>He nods. "Dangerous, but it was the only way to prevent the suspect from escaping."</p><p>"That makes perfect sense," you say. </p><p>You spend the rest of the afternoon touring the peak of beautiful Fansipan mountain, and its views of the majestic Hoàng Liên National Park. In the evening, after riding the gondola back down, the detective lets you sit behind the wheel of a police car, and even flash the sirens.',
